luminous infrared galaxy NGC 6240. The peak position of the H_2 v=1-0 S(1)
emission in the slit is located ~0.3"" - 0.4"" north of the southern nucleus. It
is almost the midpoint between the southern nucleus and the peak position of
the ^12CO J=1-0 emission. Based on the line-ratio analyses, we suggest the
excitation mechanism of H_2 is pure thermal at most positions. In the southern
region we find the following three velocity components in the H_2 emission: the
blueshifted shell component (~-250 km s^-1 with respect to V_sys) which is
recognized as a distinct C-shape distortion in the velocity field around the
southern nucleus, the high-velocity blueshifted ``wing'' component (~-1000 km
s^-1 with respect to V_sys), and the component indicating possible line
splitting of ~500 km s^-1. The latter two components are extended to the south
from the southern nucleus. We show that the kinematic properties of these three
components can be reproduced by expanding motion of a shell-like structure
around the southern nucleus. The offset peak position of the H_2 emission can
be understood if we assume that the shell expanding to the north interacts with
the extragalactic molecular gas. At the interface between the shell and the
molecular gas concentration the cloud-crushing mechanism proposed by Cowie et
al. (1981) may work efficiently, and the intense H_2 emission is thus expected
there. All these findings lead us to propose a model that the most H_2 emission
is attributed to the shock excitation driven by the superwind activity of the
southern nucleus.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.05,35,55,astro-ph

structure and the color indexes while \lambda determines mainly the surface
brightness and the bulge-to-disk ratio. We calculated star formation (SF) using
a gravitational instability criterion and a self-regulation mechanism in the
turbulent ISM. The efficiency of SF in this model is almost independent from
the mass. We show that the luminosity-dependent dust absorption empirically
determined by Wang & Heckman explains the observed color-magnitude and color
Tully-Fisher (TF) relations without the necessity of introducing a
mass-dependent SF efficiency. The disks in centrifugal equilibrium form within
growing CDM halos with a gas accretion rate proportional to the MAH. The disks

Such a very large easy-axis Ising like anisotropy along a $<111>$ direction

is because the epicyclic motion is an energy sink of the radial component of

positive. Consequently, weak convection cannot be self-sustained in Keplerian

out that to explain the coexistence of gaps and arcs on the Fermi surface the
charge modulation should be in an eggbox form. In the lack of evidences for
that, we then investigate the local pairing induced by charge-stripe
fluctuations. A proper description of the strong anisotropy of both the
interactions and the Fermi velocities requires a two-gap model for pairing. We
find that a gap due to incoherent pairing forms near the M-points, while
coherence is established by the stiffness of the pairing near the nodal points.
The model allows for a continuos evolution from a pure BCS pairing (over- and
optimally doped regime) to a mixed boson-fermion model (heavily underdoped
regime).","{'term': u'cond-mat.supr-con', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.3333333333333333,4,18,cond-mat.supr-con

(kT=0.25-0.35 keV), but the temperature is higher and the inferred emitting
area lower than expected for a 300 yr old NS according to standard cooling
models. The spectrum may also be fit with a power law model (photon index
2.8-3.6). Both the spectral properties and the timing limits of the point
source are inconsistent with a young Crab-like pulsar, but are quite similar to
the properties of the anomalous X-ray pulsars. The spectral parameters are also
very similar to those of the other radio-quiet X-ray point sources in the

for a spherical cluster. The projected radial and tangential motions of all 104
pm stars are also consistent with overall isotropy. However, the projected
velocities of the young, early type stars have a strong radial dependence. Most
of the bright HeI stars 1-10"" from SgrA* are on tangential orbits. This
anisotropy of the HeI stars and most of the brighter IRS16 complex members is
largely caused by a CW and counter-rotating, coherent rotation pattern. The
overall rotation of the young star cluster probably is a remnant of the angular
momentum in the cloud these stars formed from. The fainter, fast stars within
\~1"" of SgrA* appear to be largely moving on radial or very elliptical orbits.
We have not detected nonlinear motion for any of them. Most of the SgrA*

of relativistic jets, created near accretion disks. The spectral
characteristics of a lot of radio flares in the X-ray binaries with jets (RJXB)

programs with the RATAN-600 radio telescope of the sources: SS433, Cyg X-3,
LSI+61o303, GRS 1915+10 and some others. We also reviewed some data from the
GBI monitoring program at two frequencies and hard X-ray BATSE (20-100 keV) and
soft X-ray RTXE (2-12 keV) ASM data. We confirmed that flaring radio emission
of Cyg X-3 correlated with hard and anti-correlated with soft X-ray emission
during the strong flare (>$ Jy) in May 1997. During two orbital periods we
investigated radio light curves of the remarkable X-binary LSI+61o303. Two
flaring events near a phase 0.6 of the 26.5-day orbital period have been
detected for first time at four frequencies simultaneously. Powerful flaring
events of SS433 were detected at six frequencies in May 1996 and in May 1999.
The decay of the flare is exactly fitted by an exponential law and the rate of
the decay $\tau$ depends upon frequency as tau \propto \nu^{-0.4} in the first
flare and does not depend upon frequency in the second flare, and is equal to
\tau=6+-1 days at frequencies from 0.96 to 21.7 GHz in the last flare in May
1999. Many flaring RJXB show two, exponential and power, laws of flare decay.
Moreover, these different laws could be present in one or several flares and
commonly flare decays are faster at a higher frequency. The decay law seems to
change because of geometric form of the conical hollow jets. The synchrotron
and inverse Compton losses could explain general frequency dependences in flare
evolution. In conclusion we summarized the general radio properties of RJXB.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.0,10,16,astro-ph

GeV gamma-ray fluxes detectable by forthcoming space-borne detectors should be
produced due to bremsstrahlung of radio emitting electrons. We predict that the
power-law index of the photon flux in the GeV region should be hard, close to
the index ~2.2 expected for the acceleration spectrum of the electrons. Photon
fluxes accessible to future ground-based gamma-ray detectors could also be
expected at very high energies. The fluxes to be expected due to bremsstrahlung
and inverse Compton radiation of relativistic electrons at TeV energies should
be very steep, and strongly dependent on the characteristic magnetic fields in
Cas A. We could expect also significant fluxes of pi^0 -decay gamma-rays
produced by relativistic protons. These fluxes may extend with a hard spectrum
beyond TeV energies as far as the protons would be accelerated to energies
beyond 100 TeV. The hardness of the gamma-ray spectrum at TeV energies could in
principle allow one to distinguish between electronic and hadronic origins of

show how the decay rate factorizes at the level of the double differential

next-to-leading order in the infrared logs. Using these results, we determine
the range of cuts for which resummation is necessary, as well as the range for
which the resummed expansion itself breaks down. We also use our results to
extract the leading and next to leading infrared log contribution to the two

distribution. However, hot electrons are located right after the shock, while
most electrons are farther down stream and have cooled. This spatial

new break frequency, $\nu_{ac} < \nu_{sa}$, and a new spectral slope, $F_{\nu

galaxy NGC 6240. Stellar velocities show that the two K-band peaks separated by
1.6arcsec are the central parts of inclined, rotating disk galaxies with equal
mass bulges. The dynamical masses of the nuclei are much larger than the
stellar mass derived from the K-band light, implying that the progenitor
galaxies were galaxies with massive bulges. The K-band light is dominated by
red supergiants formed in the two nuclei in starbursts, triggered ~2x10^7 years
ago, possibly by the most recent perigalactic approach. Strong feedback effects
of a superwind and supernovae are responsible for a short duration burst
(~5x10^6 years) which is already decaying. The two galaxies form a
prograde-retrograde rotating system and from the stellar velocity field it
seems that one of the two interacting galaxies is subject to a prograde
encounter. Between the stellar nuclei is a prominent peak of molecular gas
(H_2, CO). The stellar velocity dispersion peaks there indicating that the gas
has formed a local, self-gravitating concentration decoupled from the stellar
gravitational potential. NGC 6240 has previously been reported to fit the
paradigm of an elliptical galaxy formed through the merger of two galaxies.
This was based on the near-infrared light distribution which follows a
r^1/4-law. Our data cast strong doubt on this conclusion: the system is by far
not relaxed, rotation plays an important role, as does self-gravitating gas,
and the near-infrared light is dominated by young stars.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.2,34,113,astro-ph

significantly to block the optical emergent radiation. Molecular absorptions of
TiO, VO, CrH, FeH and CaH also dominate in the early L-types showing a strength
that progressively decreases for later types. We find that the densities of
these molecules in the atmospheres are considerably smaller by larger factors
than those predicted by the chemical equilibrium. In order to reproduce the
overall shape of the optical spectra an additional opacity (AdO) is required to
be implemented in the computations. We have modelled it with a simple law [a0

AdO could be due to molecular/dust absorption or to dust scattering. The EWs
and intensities of the alkali lines are highly affected by this opacity. The Li
line at 670.8 nm, widely used as a substellarity discriminator, is more
affected by the AdO than by the natural depletion of neutral Li. Our
computations display a rather strong feature even at Teffs around 1000 K;
depending on the Teff and on the amount of dust in the atmospheres of very cool

Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) decrement measures the electron number and not the
energy content. On the other hand, the relativistic SZ increment at higher
frequencies depends strongly on the spectral shape of the electrons. We
calculate the expected Comptonization due to the energy release of radio
galaxies, which we estimate to be 3 10^66 erg Gpc^-3. We investigate
Comptonization from (a) the part of the released energy which is thermalized
and (b) the relativistic, remnant radio plasma, which may form a second,
relativistic phase in the inter galactic medium, nearly unobservable for
present day instruments (presence of so called 'radio ghosts'). We find a
thermal Comptonization parameter due to (a) of y = 10^-6 and (b) an optical
depth of relativistic electrons in old radio plasma of tau_rel < 10^-7. If a
substantial fraction of the volume of clusters of galaxies is filled with such
old radio plasma the SZ effect based determination of the Hubble constant is
biased to lower values. Finally, it is shown that a supra-thermal population of
electrons in the Coma cluster would produce a signature in the Wien-tail of the
CMB, which is marginally detectable with a multifrequency measurement by the
Planck satellite. Such a population is expected to exist, since its

spectrum is less sensitive to nongravitational energy injection, but becomes
very noisy, with large field to field variations in the power spectrum caused
by rare bright sources in the maps, which dominate in the spectrum over the
large scale structure correlations. Cross-correlation power spectrum with weak
lensing or projected galaxy distribution is significant and the

Additional emission appears in-between the features, and an underlying

third of the luminosity in the 3 to 13 mu range. The features together carry 5

changes in morphology of the red giant branch (RGB) of Galactic globular
clusters (GGC) as a function of metallicity, in the V,I bands. To this aim, two
key points are developed in the course of the analysis.
  (a) Using our photometric V,I database for Galactic globular clusters (the
largest homogeneous data sample to date; Rosenberg et al. 1999) we measure a
complete set of metallicity indices, based on the morphology and position of
the red-giant branch. In particular, we provide here the first calibration of
the S, DV_(1.1) and DV_(1.4) indices in the (V-I,V) plane. We show that our
indices are internally consistent, and we calibrate each index in terms of
metallicity, both on the Zinn & West (1984) and the Carretta & Gratton (1997)
scales. Our new calibrations of the (V-I)o,g, DV_(1.2), (V-I)_(-3.0) and
(V-I)_(-3.5) indices are consistent with existing relations.
  (b) Using a grid of selected RGB fiducial points, we define a function in the
{(V-I)o,Mi,[Fe/H]} space which is able to reproduce the whole set of GGC giant
branches in terms of a single parameter (the metallicity). As a first test, we
show that the function is able to predict the correct trend of our observed
indices with metallicity.
  The usage of this function will improve the current determinations of
metallicity and distances within the Local Group, since it allows to easily map
[(V-I)o,Mi] coordinates into {[Fe/H],Mi} ones. To this aim the ``synthetic''
RGB distribution is generated both for the currently used Lee et al. (1990)
distance scale, and for the most recent results on the RR Lyr distance scale.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.3333333333333333,14,42,astro-ph

assumed to be small. We compute the probability density function for the
smoothed dark matter density field and we extend the Press and Schechter
approach to mildly non-Gaussian density fields. The abundance of high-redshift
objects can be directly related to the non-Gaussianity parameter and thus to
the physical processes that generated deviations from the Gaussian behaviour.
Even a skewness parameter of order 0.1 implies a dramatic change in the
predicted abundance of $z\gap 1$ objects. Observations from NGST and X-ray

elastic data. The data are extremely well reproduced by our approach at all
momenta and for sufficiently high energies. The relative virtues of Born
amplitudes and of different kinds of eikonalizations are considered. An
important point in this respect is that secondary structures are predicted in
the differential cross-sections at increasing energies and these phenomena
appear quite directly related to the procedure of eikonalizing the various Born
amplitudes. We conclude that these secondary structures arise naturally within
the eikonalized procedure (although their precise localization turns out to be
model dependent). The fitting procedure naturally predicts the appearance of a
zero at small $|t|$ in the real part of the even amplitude as anticipated by
general theorems. We would like to stress, once again, how important it would
be to have at LHC both $pp$ and $p \bar p$ options for many questions connected

our predictions.","{'term': u'hep-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.3333333333333333,28,46,hep-ph

seconds and recurrence times of hours to days) allow for a very stringent
comparison to theory. The largest discrepancy (which was found with EXOSAT

Bursts become less frequent and energetic as the global accretion rate
increases, just the opposite of what the spherical theory predicts. I present a
resolution of this issue by taking seriously the observed dependence of the
burning area on the global accretion rate, which implies that as the accretion
rate increases, the accretion rate per unit area decreases. This resurrects the
unsolved problem of knowing where the freshly accreted material accumulates on
the star, equally relevant to the likely signs of rotation during the bursts

doubling/halving time scale comprised in the range 30-75 ks. A model composed
by a simple power-law, with photon index ~1.8 and an absorption edge, whose
threshold energy is consistent with K-shell photoionization of OVII, provides
an adequate fit of the spectrum. This suggests that we are observing the
emission from the nuclear region through a warm absorber of N_H a few
10^{21}/cm/cm. If it has internal dust with Galactic gas-to-dust ratio, it
could explain the lack of broad Hbeta emission, even in the episodic presence
of a broad Halpha emission line. Optical spectra obtained over several years
show indeed variations in the strength of this broad Halpha component. A
distribution of dusty, optically thick matter on spatial scales a few hundreds
parsec, which does not intercept the line of sight towards the nucleus, is
probably required to account simultaneously for the relative [OIII] luminosity
deficit in comparison to the X-rays. The high IR to X-ray luminosity ratio is

orientifold projection. We point out that T-duality in the presence of B-flux
is more subtle than in the case with trivial B-flux, and it is precisely
consistent with the qualitative difference between the aforementioned two
setups. In the case where both types of branes are present, the states in the
mixed (e.g., 59) open string sectors come with a non-trivial multiplicity,
which we relate to a discrete gauge symmetry due to non-zero B-flux, and
construct vertex operators for the the mixed sector states. Using these results
we revisit K3 orientifolds with B-flux (where K3 is a T^4/Z_M orbifold) and
point out various subtleties arising in some of these models. For instance, in
the Z_2 case the conformal field theory orbifold does not appear to be the
consistent background for the corresponding orientifolds with B-flux. This is
related to the fact that non-zero B-flux requires the presence of both O5^- as
well as O5^+ planes at various Z_2 orbifold fixed points, which appears to be
inconsistent with the presence of the twisted B-flux in the conformal field

model gradients with those observed in the Hubble Deep Field. The models are
constructed so as to reproduce color gradients in local elliptical galaxies

degeneracy is solved. The observed color gradients in elliptical galaxies at
$z=0.1-1.0$ agree excellently with those predicted by the metallicity gradient,
while they deviates significantly from those predicted by the age gradient even
at $z \sim 0.3$ and the deviation is getting larger with increasing redshift.

extremely metal-poor halo K dwarfs are present in approximately equal numbers

sample of 552 late-type dwarfs. This sample was built from the intersection of
photometric catalogues with chromospheric activity surveys of the Mount Wilson
group. For these stars, metallicities were estimated from uvby data, and ages
were calculated from their chromospheric emission levels using a new
metallicity-dependent chromospheric activity-age relation developed by
Rocha-Pinto & Maciel (1998). A careful estimate of the errors in the
chromospheric age is made. The errors in the chromospheric indices are shown to
include partially the effects of the stellar magnetic cycles, although a
detailed treatment of this error is still beyond our knowledge. It is shown
that the results are not affected by the presence of unresolved binaries in the
sample. We derive an age-metallicity relation which confirms the mean trend
found by previous workers. The mean metallicity shows a slow, steady increase
with time, amounting at least 0.56 dex in 15 Gyr. The initial metallicity of
the disk is around -0.70 dex, in agreement with the G dwarf metallicity
distribution. According to our data, the intrinsic cosmic dispersion in metal
abundances is around 0.13 dex, a factor of two smaller than that found by
Edvardsson et al. (1993). We show that chromospheric ages are compatible with
isochrone ages, within the expected errors, so that the difference in the
scatter cannot be caused by the accuracy of our ages and metallicities. This
reinforces some suggestions that the Edvarsson et al.'s sample is not suitable

over these variables, we obtain an effective propagation for massless fields

significantly affected when they are propagated forward in time. Concomitantly,
we find that the asymptotic properties of Hawking radiation are not severely

metric fluctuations once their blue shifted frequency reaches the inverse
critical length. All these properties bear many resemblences with those
obtained in models for black hole radiation based on a modified dispersion
relation. This strongly suggests that the physical origin of these models,

permitted and with Compton preheating included a new high temperature PADAF
branch appears in the solution space. In the absence of preheating, high
temperature flows do not exist when the mass accretion rate mdot == Mdot c^2 /
L_E >~ 10^-1.5. Below this mass accretion rate, a roughly conical region around
the hole cannot sustain high temperature ions and electrons for all flows
having mdot >~ 10^-4, which may lead to a funnel possibly filled with a tenuous
hot outgoing wind. If the flow starts at large radii with the usual equilibrium
temperature ~10^4 K, the critical mass accretion rate is much lower, mdot
\~10^-3.7 above which level no self-consistent ADAF (without preheating) can

self-consistently maintained at high temperature if Compton preheating is
considered. These solutions constitute a new branch of solutions as in
spherical accretion flows. High temperature PADAF flows can exist above the
critical mass accretion rate in addition to the usual cold thin disk solutions.

represent the complex configuration interaction (CI). Fe V bound levels are
obtained with angular and spin symmetries $SL\pi$ and $J\pi$ of the (e + Fe VI)
system such that $2S+1$ = 5,3,1, $L \leq$ 10, $J \leq 8$. The bound levels are
obtained as solutions of the Breit-Pauli (e + ion) Hamiltonian for each $J\pi$,
and are designated according to the `collision' channel quantum numbers. A
major task has been the identification of these large number of bound fine
structure levels in terms of standard spectroscopic designations. A new scheme,
based on the analysis of quantum defects and channel wavefunctions, has been
developed. The identification scheme aims particularly to determine the
completeness of the results in terms of all possible bound levels for
applications to analysis of experimental measurements and plasma modeling. An
uncertainty of 10-20% for most transitions is estimated.","{'term': u'physics.atom-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",1.0,31,33,physics.atom-ph

behavior at high density. Effects of Landau quantization in ultra-strong
magnetic fields ($B>10^{14}$ Gauss) lead to a reduction in the electron
chemical potential and a substantial increase in the proton fraction. We find
the generic result for $B>10^{18}$ Gauss that the softening of the EOS caused
by Landau quantization is overwhelmed by stiffening due to the incorporation of
the anomalous magnetic moments of the nucleons. In addition, the neutrons
become completely spin polarized. The inclusion of ultra-strong magnetic fields
leads to a dramatic increase in the proton fraction, with consequences for the
direct Urca process and neutron star cooling. The magnetization of the matter
never appears to become very large, as the value of $|H/B|$ never deviates from

sources, which is estimated for 80% of the FRII sources in the 3CRR complete

asymmetric model is in agreement with a wide range of observational data, and
that the relativistic and intrinsic asymmetry effects are of comparable
importance. Intrinsic/environmental asymmetry effects are more important at
high radio luminosities and small physical scales. The mean translational speed
of the lobes is found to be 0.11c, consistent with the speeds found from

fixed point, characterized by exponents $z=2$ and $\lambda \approx 5$. This
`torque-driven' fixed point is approached at times such that $g^2 t\gg 1$,
where $g$ is the strength of the torque. All physical quantities, like the
domain size $L(t)$ and the equal and unequal time correlation functions obey a
crossover scaling form over the entire range of $g$. An attempt to understand
this crossover behavior from the approximate Gaussian Closure Scheme fails
completely, implying that the dynamics at late times cannot be understood from
the dynamics of defects alone. We provide convincing arguments that the spin
configurations can be decomposed in terms of defects and spin-waves which
interact with each other even at late times. In the absence of the torque term,
the spin waves decay faster, but even so we find that the Gaussian closure
scheme is inconsistent. In the latter case the inconsistency may be remedied by
including corrections to a simple gaussian distribution. For completeness we
include a discussion of the ordering dynamics at $T_c$, where the torque is
shown to be relevant, with exponents $z=4-\epsilon/2$ and $\lambda = d$ (where
$\epsilon = 6-d$). We show to all orders in perturbation theory that

an increase of Li with [Fe/H] is seen, interpreted as evidence of Galactic
chemical evolution (GCE) of Li, primarily due to Galactic cosmic ray (GCR)
spallation reactions in the era of halo formation. The rate of Li evolution is
concordant with: (1) observations of spallative 6Li in halo dwarfs; (2) GCE
models; and (3) data on Li in higher metallicity halo stars. New data have also
revealed four new ultra-Li-deficient halo dwarfs, doubling the number known.
Based on their propensity to cluster at the halo main sequence turnoff and also
to exist redward of the turnoff, we hypothesise that they are the products of
binary mergers that ultimately will become blue stragglers. We explain their
low Li abundances by normal pre-main-sequence (and possibly main-sequence)
destruction in the low mass stars prior to their merging. If this explanation
is correct, then such stars need no longer be considered an embarrassment to
the existence of negligible Li destruction in the majority of field halo
dwarfs.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.0,10,41,astro-ph

that (a) for the outgoing wave into the horizon one has a `miraculous'

when galaxies trace the underlying mass distribution and galaxy positions and

predicted velocities are correlated with the predicted velocities themselves.
We investigate this bias using cosmological N-body simulations and analytic
arguments. In linear perturbation theory, for cold dark matter power spectra
and Gaussian or top hat smoothing filters, the bias in Omega is always
positive, and its magnitude increases with increasing smoothing scale. This
linear calculation reproduces the N-body results for Gaussian smoothing radii
R_s > 10 Mpc/h, while non-linear effects lower the bias on smaller smoothing
scales, and for R_s < 3 Mpc/h Omega is underestimated rather than
overestimated. The net bias in Omega for a given smoothing filter depends on
the underlying cosmological model. The effect on current estimates of Omega
from velocity-velocity comparisons is probably small relative to other
uncertainties, but taking full advantage of the statistical precision of future
peculiar velocity data sets will require either equal smoothing of the
predicted and measured velocity fields or careful accounting for the biases

X-ray absorption with column densities in the range 10^22-23.5 cm-2 is common

the same level of activity observed in 1978.
  In both BeppoSAX observations the X-ray spectrum of the source is well
represented by a power law with spectral index Gamma ~ 1.7, absorbed by a
column density of N_H ~ 10^{22} cm^{-2} and characterized by a prominent iron
K\alpha line. While in the second BeppoSAX data set the line properties appear
to be consistent with those expected from accretion disc models, in the first
BeppoSAX data set the iron feature is rather peculiar. The broadening is not
significant and the line energy is E_{K\alpha}=6.62 +/- 0.07 keV, indicating
emission from highly ionized iron. The line has too high equivalent width (~
700 eV) to be produced by a hot scattering medium. By comparing these data with
data previously in the literature, we interpret the spectral and flux changes
in terms of different phases of rebuilding an accretion disc. The timescale for
the disc rebuilding is estimated to range between 1 and 5 years.

that superpotential interactions couple the flat directions to other fields,
which acquire masses induced by the flat-direction vev that may be sufficiently
small for them to be kinematically accessible to inflaton decay. The resulting
plasma of inflaton decay products then may act on the flat directions via these

also terminated earlier, due to evaporation of the flat direction condensate

high-redshift Type Ia supernovae. Following previous studies, the early light
curve is modeled using a t-squared law, which is then mated with a modified
Leibundgut template light curve. The best-fit t-squared law is determined for
ensemble samples of low- and high-redshift supernovae by fitting simultaneously
for all light curve parameters for all supernovae in each sample. Our method
fully accounts for the non-negligible covariance amongst the light curve
fitting parameters, which previous analyses have neglected. Contrary to Riess
et al. (1999), we find fair to good agreement between the rise times of the
low- and high-redshift Type Ia supernovae. The uncertainty in the rise time of
the high-redshift Type Ia supernovae is presently quite large (roughly +/- 1.2
days statistical), making any search for evidence of evolution based on a
comparison of rise times premature. Furthermore, systematic effects on rise
time determinations from the high-redshift observations, due to the form of the
late-time light curve and the manner in which the light curves of these
supernovae were sampled, can bias the high-redshift rise time determinations by
up to +3.6/-1.9 days under extreme situations. The peak brightnesses - used for
cosmology - do not suffer any significant bias, nor any significant increase in
uncertainty.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.5,18,37,astro-ph

number of companions per galaxy, within a specified range in absolute
magnitude. N_c is directly related to the galaxy merger rate. The second
statistic, called L_c, gives the total luminosity in companions, per galaxy.
This quantity can be used to investigate the mass accretion rate. Both N_c and
L_c are related to the galaxy correlation function and luminosity function in a
straightforward manner. We outline techniques which account for various
selection effects, and demonstrate the success of this approach using Monte
Carlo simulations. If one assumes that clustering is independent of luminosity
(which is appropriate for reasonable ranges in luminosity), then these
statistics may be applied to flux-limited surveys.
  These techniques are applied to a sample of 5426 galaxies in the SSRS2
redshift survey. Using close dynamical pairs, we find N_c(-21<M_B<-18) =

present day galaxies with -21<M_B<-18 have undergone mergers since z=1. When
applied to redshift surveys of more distant galaxies, these techniques will

represent different temperatures of the accretion disk, related to different

the light profile of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the rich cluster

virial radius of the cluster (2 h^{-1} Mpc; Girardi et al. 1998), indicating
that the sizes of the BCG and the cluster are comparable. We find that the
profile is consistent with a de Vaucouleurs profile over the radial range

contributes 36% of the total cluster light within 500 h^{-1} kpc. Including all
luminous components, we obtain M/L_I~160 h for the cluster, which would be
overestimated by ~20% without the BCG halo. Furthermore, the relatively red
color of the BCG at large radii suggests that recent disruption and tidal
stripping of spirals and dwarf ellipticals do not contribute significantly to
the halo luminosity. The color and the form of the profile are consistent with
a scenario in which the BCG forms from filamentary collapse during the epoch of
cluster formation, with relatively little evolution in the past 5 Gyrs

correlation of the T-odd one-particle fragmentation functions found by DELPHI

transversal momenta, this correlation is of 1.6% order, which means order of

0.1448d, a mass ratio, q=Mbright/Mfaint of q=0.70+-0.03 and a difference in the
gravitational redshifts of 11.5+-2.3km/s. The masses of the close pair of white
dwarfs predicted by the mass ratio and gravitational redshift difference
combined with theoretical cooling curves are 0.39+-0.05 solar mass and
0.56+-0.07 solar masses. WD1704+481 is therefore also likely to be the first

electrons in highly nonuniform, small-scale magnetic fields is different from
synchrotron radiation if the electron's transverse deflections in these fields
are much smaller than the beaming angle. A quantitative analytical theory of
this radiation, which we refer to as jitter radiation, is developed. It is
shown that the emergent spectrum is determined by statistical properties of the
magnetic field. As an example,we then use the model of a magnetic field in
internal shocks of GRBs. The spectral power distribution of radiation produced
by the power-law electrons is well described by a sharply broken power-law with
indices 1 and -(p-1)/2 and the jitter break frequency is independent of the
field strength but depends on the electron density in the ejecta. Since
large-scale fields may also be present in the ejecta, we construct a
two-component, jitter+synchrotron spectral model of the prompt $\gamma$-ray
emission. Quite surprisingly, this model seems to be readily capable of
explaining several properties of time-resolved spectra of some GRBs, such as
(i) the violation of the constraint on the low-energy spectral index called the
synchrotron ``line of death'', (ii) the sharp spectral break at the peak
frequency, inconsistent with the broad synchrotron bump, (iii) the evidence for
two spectral sub-components, and (iv) possible existence of emission features
called ``GRB lines''. We believe these facts strongly support both the
existence of small-scale magnetic fields and the proposed radiation mechanism
from GRB shocks. As an example, we use the composite model to analyze GRB

behaviour of Schrodinger electron (SchEl) and bring to light on the cause for

describe the forced stochastically diverse circular oscillation motion, created
by force of the electrical interaction of the SchEl's elementary electric
charge with the electric intensity of the resultant quantum electromagnetic
field of the existing StchVrtPhtns, as a solution of Abraham-Lorentz equation.
By dint of this equation we obtain that the smooth thin line of a classical
macro particle is rapidly broken of many short and disorderly orientated lines,
owing the continuous dispersion of the quantum micro particle (QntMicrPrt) on
the StchVrtPhtns. Between two successive scattering the centers of diverse
circular oscillations with stochastically various radii are moving along this

perpendicular to same disordered short line, along which are moving its

line QSO as a function of redshift. The QSO stacked spectra, in the observers
0.1-2 keV band, in five redshift bins over the range 0.1<z<3.2 apparently
harden from an equivalent photon index of 2.6 at z=0.4 to ~2.1 at z=2.4 as seen
in other QSO samples. In contrast, the spectra in the 0.5-2 keV band show no
significant variation in spectral index with redshift. This suggests the
presence of a spectral upturn at low energies (<0.5 keV). Indeed, while at high
redshifts (z>1.0) the single power-law model gives an acceptable fit to the
data over the full energy band, at lower redshifts the spectra need a second
component at low energies, a `soft excess'. Inclusion of a simple model for the
soft excess, i.e. a black-body component (kT~100 eV), results in a significant
improvement to the model fit, and yields power-law slopes of 1.8-1.9, for all
redshift bins. This power-law is not inconsistent, within the error bars, with
those of nearby AGN in the 2-10 keV band, suggesting that the same intrinsic
power-law slope may continue from 10 keV down to below 0.5 keV. We caution that
there is a possibility that the spectral upturn observed may not represent a
real physical component but could be due to co-adding spectra with a large
dispersion in spectral indices. Regardless of the origin of the soft excess,
the average QSO spectrum has important consequences for the origin of the X-ray
background: the average spectra of the typical, faint, high redshift QSO are
significantly steeper than the spectrum of the X-ray background extending the

betwen the halos and one from correlations within the same halo. We show that
such a model can give dark matter power spectra which match well with the
results of N-body simulations, provided that concentration parameter decreases
with the halo mass.
  Galaxy power spectrum differs from dark matter power spectrum because pair
weighted number of galaxies increases less rapidly than the halo mass, as
predicted by theoretical models and observed in clusters. In this case the
resulting power spectrum becomes a power law with the slope closed to the
observed. Such a model also predicts a later onset of nonlinear clustering
compared to the dark matter, which is needed to reconcile the CDM models with

nonmonotonic. For red or elliptical galaxies bias in power spectrum may be
scale dependent even on very large scales.

covering simultaneously the I, J, H, and K bands, for a sample of 15 Seyfert
galaxies and the N5253 starburst nucleus, are presented. The Seyfert galaxies
were selected as presenting `linear' or cone-like high excitation emission line
in the optical, most probably due to the collimation of the central source's
radiation by a dusty molecular torus. Our goal was to look for signatures of
this torus, and to investigate the gaseous distribution, excitation and
reddening. The IR emission lines are spatially extended in most cases, and we
have used the [FeII]/Pa(beta) ratio as a measure of the gaseous excitation in
Mrk573, N1386, and N7582. Values for this ratio between 1.5 and 6 are found,
suggesting excitation of [FeII] by X-rays or shock waves in some regions.
Nuclear Pa(beta) in N1365, and possibly nuclear Br(gama) in Mrk573, are broad.
  From analysis of the spatial distribution of the continuum (J-H) and (H-K)
colours derived from our spectra, we find redder colours for the nucleus than
the nearby bulge in most of the Seyfert 2s observed. Comparison with models
including emission from dust and stars shows that hot (T~1000 K) dust emission
dominates the nuclear continuum in N1365, N2110, N3281, N7582, and ESO362-G18.
In N1386, N5643, and N5728 the main contributor is the underlying stellar
population, combined with some foreground reddening and/or cool dust emission.
In a few cases, the (J-H) colours on opposite sides of the nucleus differ by
0.3-0.8 mag, an effect that we interpret as partly due to differences in the
local stellar population, and possibly extinction gradients.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.3333333333333333,19,71,astro-ph

noncocommutative Hopf algebra of rooted trees, decorated by an infinite set of
primitive divergences. The Hopf algebra of undecorated rooted trees, ${\cal
H}_R$, generated by a single primitive divergence, solves a universal problem
in Hochschild cohomology. It has two nontrivial closed Hopf subalgebras: the
cocommutative subalgebra ${\cal H}_{\rm ladder}$ of pure ladder diagrams and
the Connes-Moscovici noncocommutative subalgebra ${\cal H}_{\rm CM}$ of
noncommutative geometry. These three Hopf algebras admit a bigrading by $n$,
the number of nodes, and an index $k$ that specifies the degree of primitivity.
In each case, we use iterations of the relevant coproduct to compute the
dimensions of subspaces with modest values of $n$ and $k$ and infer a simple
generating procedure for the remainder. The results for ${\cal H}_{\rm ladder}$
are familiar from the theory of partitions, while those for ${\cal H}_{\rm CM}$
involve novel transforms of partitions. Most beautiful is the bigrading of
${\cal H}_R$, the largest of the three. Thanks to Sloane's {\tt superseeker},
we discovered that it saturates all possible inequalities. We prove this by
using the universal Hochschild-closed one-cocycle $B_+$, which plugs one set of
divergences into another, and by generalizing the concept of natural growth
beyond that entailed by the Connes-Moscovici case. We emphasize the yet greater

a magnetic trap. Neutral and charged particle traps are widely used tool for
studying both composite and elementary particles, because they allow long
interaction times and isolation from perturbing environments. Here we report
the magnetic trapping of neutrons. The trapping region is filled with
superfluid 4-He, which is used to load neutrons into the trap and as a

The flanking fields (FF fields) of the Hubble deep fields were used to extend
the magnitude range for which we compute correlation amplitudes towards
brighter magnitude bins. This allows easier comparison of the amplitudes to
ground based data. The newly measured correlation amplitudes as a function of
magnitude limit were compared to previously published measurements at larger
separations. For this comparison, the correlation function was approximated by
a power law with an index of 0.8. The scatter in the correlation amplitudes is
too large to be explained by random errors. We argue that the most likely cause

solving the linearized equations for perturbation. We compute the evolution of
the inner region of the proto-cloud with our SPH code for various initial
radius and initial composition of gases. When the initial gases contain no
heavy elements, the evolution of proto-clouds sensitively depends on the
initial radius. For a smaller initial radius, the initial star burst is so
intense that the subsequent star formation occurs in the central regions to
form a dense star cluster as massive as the globular cluster. When the initial
gases contain some heavy elements, the metallicity of gases affects the
evolution and the final stellar mass. If the initial radius of the
proto-globular clouds was relatively large, the formation of a star cluster as
massive as the globular clusters requires the initial metallicity as high as
[Fe/H] $\geq -2$. The self-enrichment of heavy elements in the star cluster
does not occur in all cases.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.5,17,55,astro-ph

a supermassive BH at their center. This has been assessed using a variety of
observational techniques, from stellar and/or gas dynamics to megamasers. Yet
another promising technique is offered by the case of the Virgo elliptical NGC
4552, in which early HST/FOC observations revealed a central low-luminosity
flare. Subsequent HST/FOS observations with a 0.21 arcsec aperture have
revealed a rich emission-line spectrum with broad and narrow components with
FWHM of 3000 and 700 km/s, respectively. This variable, mini-AGN at the center
of NGC 4552 is most naturally the result of a sporadic accretion event on a
central BH. It has a H$\alpha$ luminosity of only $\sim 10,000 \lsun$, making
it the likely, intrinsically faintest AGN known today. Only thanks to the
superior resolution of HST such a faint object has been discovered and studied
in detail, but adaptive optics systems on large ground-based telescopes may
reveal in the future that a low level of accretion onto central massive BHs is
an ubiquitous phenomenon among galactic spheroids. FOC/FOS observations of a
central spike in NGC 2681 reveal several analogies with the case of NGC 4552,
while yet another example is offered by a recent exciting finding with STIS by
R.W. O'Connell in NGC 1399, the third galaxy in our original program.

accretion shocks, rather than static density discontinuities. The density
histograms (PDFs) of these runs exhibit either bimodal shapes or a single peak
at low densities plus a slope change at high densities. Final static situations
may be established, but the equilibrium is very fragile: small density
fluctuations in the warm phase require large variations in the density of the
cold phase, probably inducing shocks into the clouds. This result suggests that
such configurations are highly unlikely. Simulations including turbulent
forcing show that large- scale forcing is incapable of erasing the signature of
the TI in the density PDFs, but small-scale, stellar-like forcing causes
erasure of the signature of the instability. However, these simulations do not
reach stationary regimes, TI driving an ever-increasing star formation rate.
Simulations including magnetic fields, self-gravity and the Coriolis force show
no significant difference between the PDFs of stable and unstable cases, and
reach stationary regimes, suggesting that the combination of the stellar
forcing and the extra effective pressure provided by the magnetic field and the
Coriolis force overwhelm TI as a density-structure generator in the ISM. We

staggered magnetization, the two-spin correlation functions, the correlation
lengths, and the static spin susceptibility are calculated self-consistently
over the whole temperature region, where the effects of spatial anisotropy are
explored. As compared with previous spin-wave approaches, the N\'{e}el
temperature is reduced by the improved description of SRO. The maximum in the
temperature dependence of the uniform static susceptibility is shifted with
anisotropy and is ascribed to the decrease of SRO with increasing temperature.
Comparing the theory with experimental data for the magnetization and
correlation length of La$_2$CuO$_4$, a good agreement in the temperature
dependences is obtained.","{'term': u'cond-mat.str-el', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.5,18,35,cond-mat.str-el

form in compressed rather than in expanded overlayers beyond a critical lattice
misfit. In the latter case the classical Stranski-Krastanov growth is expected
to occur because the misfit dislocations can become energetically favored at
smaller island sizes. The thermodynamic reason for coherent 3D islanding is the
incomplete wetting owing to the weaker adhesion of the edge atoms. Monolayer
height islands with a critical size appear as necessary precursors of the 3D
islands. The latter explains the experimentally observed narrow size
distribution of the 3D islands. The 2D-3D transformation takes place by
consecutive rearrangements of mono- to bilayer, bi- to trilayer islands, etc.,
after exceeding the corresponding critical sizes. The rearrangements are

been derived for WZ Cas and WX Cyg, perhaps two SC-type rather than J-type
carbon stars. The Rb abundances, obtained from the resonance 7800 {\AA} Rb I
line, are surprisingly low, probably due to strong non-LTE effects in the
formation of this line in cool carbon-rich stars. Lithium and $^{13}$C are
found to be enhanced in all the stars. These results together with the nitrogen
abundances and oxygen isotope ratios measured by Lambert et al. (1986) and
Harris et al. (1987) are used to discuss the origin of J-stars. The luminosity
and variability class of the stars studied would indicate that they are low
mass (M$\leq 2-3$ M$_\odot$), less evolved objects than the normal carbon
stars, although the presence of some luminous (M$_{bol}<-5.5$) J-stars in our
galaxy (WZ Cas may be an example) and in other galaxies, suggests the existence
of at least two types of J-stars, with different formation scenarios depending
upon the initial mass of the parent star. Standard evolutionary AGB models are
difficult to reconcile with all the observed chemical characteristics. In fact,
they suggest the existence of an extra-mixing mechanism which transports
material from the convective envelope down to hotter regions where some nuclear
burning occurs. This mechanism would act preferably on the early-AGB phase in
low-mass stars. Mixing at the He-core flash and the binary system hypothesis

fundamental element are equal to the fundamental length. This definition
enables to describe correctly the passage from the space of the formless finite
fundamental elements to the continual space in the limit of zero value of the
fundamental length. FFFE space-time functional integral construction is
suggested. A wave function of a separate FFFE and the overall wave function of
a manifold are introduced. It is shown that many other constructions of the
discrete space-time (the Regge coverings, the lattice space-time etc.) are the
special cases of this space-time. A vacuum action problem is analyzed. One term
of this action is proportional to the volume of a fundamental element. It is
possible to direct the way for this term to yield the Nambu-Goto action in

Fermionic and bosonic fields in the space-time of FFFEs are excited states of
elements. Space-time supersymmetry leads to supposition that the maximal
possible number of fermionic excitations at one FFFE is equal to the number of

diverging as the inverse of the doping, that seems in agreement with numerical
datas. Second, in the weak-coupling region, Kondo insulating transitions arise
due to the consequent renormalization of the backward Kondo scattering. Here,
the interplay between Kondo effect and electron-electron interactions gives
rise to significant phenomena in transport, in the high-temperature delocalized
(ballistic) regime. For repulsive interactions, as a perfect signature of Kondo
localization, the conductivity is found to decrease monotonically with
temperature. When interactions become attractive, spin fluctuations in the
electron (Luttinger-type) liquid are suddenly lowered. The latter is less
localized by magnetic impurities than for the repulsive counterpart, and as a
result a large jump in the Drude weight and a maximum in the conductivity arise
in the entrance of the Kondo insulating phase. These can be viewed as remnants
of s-wave superconductivity arising for attractive enough interactions.

Its application to HI shows that in cold neutral hydrogen the velocity

to dominate the formation of small scale structures that can be erroneously

the Goldreich-Shridhar picture of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, but the
cascade from the scales of several kpc that this interpretation involves does
not fit well in the current paradigm of energy injection. The issue whether
magnetic field does make the turbulence anisotropic is still open, but if this

""wavy"" electron capture layers, whose horizontal density variations naturally
create a mass quadrupole moment.
  We present a full calculation of the crust's elastic adjustment to these
density perturbations and find that the elastic response of the crust reduces
Bildsten's original estimate of the quadrupole moment in the thin outer crust
by a factor of 20-50. However, this basic picture, when applied to capture
layers in the deep inner crust, can generate quadrupoles in the necessary range
as long as there are ~5% lateral temperature variations in the inner crust. By
calculating the thermal flow throughout the core and the crust, we find that
temperature gradients this large are easily maintained by asymmetric heat
sources or lateral composition gradients in the crust.
  We also derive a general relation between the stresses and strains in the
crust and the maximum quadrupole moment they can generate. We show under quite
general conditions that maintaining a quadrupole of the magnitude necessary to
balance the accretion torque requires dimensionless strains close to 0.01 at

In the first method, the parameters of the galactic rotation curve and the free
parameters of the spiral density waves were obtained from Cepheid kinematics,
under different assumptions. To turn visible the structure corresponding to
these models, we computed the evolution of an ensemble of N-particles,
simulating the ISM clouds, in the perturbed galactic gravitational field. In

the Sun happens to be practically at the corotation circle. As an additional

at accessible wavelengths. We review and quantify empirical correlations
between bolometric luminosities produced by star formation and the UV, mid-IR,
sub-mm, and radio luminosities of galaxies in the local universe. These
correlations suggest that observations of high-redshift galaxies at any of
these wavelengths should constrain their star-formation rates to within
0.2--0.3 dex. We assemble the limited evidence that high-redshift galaxies obey
these locally calibrated correlations. The characteristic luminosities and dust
obscurations of galaxies at z ~ 0, z ~ 1, and z ~ 3 are reviewed. After
discussing the relationship between the high-redshift populations selected in
surveys at different wavelengths, we calculate the contribution to the 850um
background from each. The available data show that a correlation between
star-formation rate and dust obscuration L_dust/L_UV exists at low and high
redshift. This correlation plays a central role in the major conclusion of this
paper: most star formation at high redshift occurred in galaxies with 1 <
L_dust/L_UV < 100 similar to those that host the majority of star formation in
the local universe and to those that are detected in UV-selected surveys.

microlensing light-curves with unprecedented coverage. These demonstrate
smooth, independent (therefore microlensing) variability between the images

appearance of new critical images. Our models predict that the next image C
event is most likely to arrive 500 days following the 1999 peak, but with a
large uncertainty (100-2000 days). Finally, given the image A light-curve

a caustic crossing will occur between the 1999 and 2000 observing seasons,

histories, for a Lambda CDM model, were generated and used to calculate the
virialization of dark matter (DM) haloes. A diversity of halo density profiles
were obtained, the most typical one being close to the NFW profile. We modeled
the formation of discs in centrifugal equilibrium within the evolving DM haloes
using gas accretion rates proportional to the halo mass aggregation rates, and
assuming detailed angular momentum conservation. We calculated the
gravitational interactions between halo and disc, and the hydrodynamics, star
formation, and evolution of the galaxy discs. We found that the slope and
zero-point of the infrared Tully-Fisher relations (TFR) may be explained as a
direct consequence of the cosmological initial conditions. This relation is
almost independent of the assumed disc mass fraction. The rms scatter of the
TFR originates mainly from the scatter in the DM halo structure and, to a minor
extension, from the dispersion of the primordial spin parameter. The scatter
obtained does not disagree with the observational estimates. Our models allow
us to understand why the residuals of the TFR do not correlate significantly
with disc size or surface brightness (SB), and why low and high SB galaxies
have the same TFR. The correlations between gas fraction and SB, and between
scale length and V_max agree with those observed. The discs present nearly
exponential SB distributions. The shape of the rotation curves changes with the
SB and is nearly flat for most cases. The rotation curve decompositions show a
dominance of DM down to very small radii. The introduction of shallow cores in

on-going controversy complicated by the need of defining a model of fundamental
prices. Here, we present a novel empirical method which bypasses all the
difficulties of the previous approaches by monitoring external indicators of an
anomalously growing interest in the public at times of bubbles. From the
definition of a bubble as a self-fulfilling reinforcing price change, we
identify indicators of a possible self-reinforcing imitation between agents in
the market. We show that during the build-up phase of a bubble, there is a
growing interest in the public for the commodity in question, whether it
consists in stocks, diamonds or coins. That interest can be estimated through
different indicators: increase in the number of books published on the topic,
increase in the subscriptions to specialized journals. Moreover, the well-known
empirical rule according to which the volume of sales is growing during a bull
market finds a natural interpretation in this framework: sales increases in
fact reveal and pinpoint the progress of the bubble's diffusion throughout
society. We also present a simple model of rational expectation which maps
exactly onto the Ising model on a random graph. The indicators are then
interpreted as ``thermometers'', measuring the balance between idiosyncratic
information (noise temperature) and imitation (coupling) strength. In this
context, bubbles are interpreted as low or critical temperature phases, where
the imitation strength carries market prices up essentially independently of
fundamentals. Contrary to the naive conception of a bubble and a crash as times
of disorder, on the contrary, we show that bubbles and crashes are times where
the concensus is too strong.","{'term': u'cond-mat.stat-mech', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",1.0,25,51,cond-mat.stat-mech

hedged portfolio, and we conclude that no model can a priori be expected to
price all exotics in line with the vanilla options market. Calibration of an
assumed underlying process from vanilla options alone must not be overly
restrictive, yet still unique, and relevant to all exotic options of interest.
For the implied tree we show that the calibration to real-world prices allows
us to only price vanilla options themselves correctly. This is usually
attributed to the incompleteness of the market under traditional stochastic
(local) volatility models. We show that some `weakly' stochastic volatility
models without quadratic variation of the volatilities avoid the incompleteness
problems, but they introduce arbitrage. More generally, we find that any

reported by Pando, Valls-Gabaud & Fang (1998), using a technique based on the
discrete wavelet transform. Their analysis was performed on the two DMR faces
centred on the North and South Galactic poles respectively, using the
Daubechies 4 wavelet basis. We show that these results depend critically on the
orientation of the data, and so should be treated with caution. For two
distinct orientations of the data, we calculate unbiased estimates of the
skewness, kurtosis and scale-scale correlation of the corresponding wavelet
coefficients in all of the available scale domains of the transform. We obtain
several detections of non-Gaussianity in the DMR-DSMB map at greater than the
99 per cent confidence level, but most of these occur on pixel-pixel scales and
are therefore not cosmological in origin. Indeed, after removing all multipoles
beyond $\ell = 40$ from the COBE maps, only one robust detection remains.
Moreover, using Monte-Carlo simulations, we find that the probability of
obtaining such a detection by chance is 0.59. We repeat the analysis for the
53+90 GHz coadded COBE map. In this case, after removing $\ell > 40$
multipoles, two non-Gaussian detections at the 99 per cent level remain.
Nevertheless, again using Monte-Carlo simulations, we find that the probability
of obtaining two such detections by chance is 0.28. Thus, we conclude the
wavelet technique does {\em not} yield strong evidence for non-Gaussianity of
cosmological origin in the 4-year COBE data.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.5,7,34,astro-ph

the construction of orbifolds that are a consequence of the fact that the
action of the orbifold elements on degenerate ground states is not unambiguous.
We explain that there exists an additional consistency condition, related to
the spectrum of D-branes in the theory, which eliminates these ambiguities. For
supersymmetric orbifolds this condition turns out to be equivalent to the

large-scale X-ray survey designed to find and characterize very massive,
distant clusters of galaxies. Based on X-ray detections in the ROSAT All-Sky
Survey, MACS aims to compile a sample of more than 200 X-ray luminous clusters
at z>0.3, about 50 times the number of EMSS clusters in the same redshift and
luminosity range. The MACS sample is uniquely suited to investigate cluster
evolution at redshifts and luminosities poorly sampled by all existing surveys.
  At the time of writing the MACS sample comprises 41 clusters with measured
redshifts of 0.3<z<0.56 and X-ray luminosities in excess of 6 10^44 erg/s
(0.1-2.4 keV). This early sample is thus already twice as large as the high-z,
high-luminosity subsets of the EMSS, BCS, and REFLEX cluster samples taken
together. An additional 85 MACS clusters with photometric redshifts z>0.3 are
scheduled for spectroscopic observation.
  From a preliminary analysis of a statistically well defined subsample of the
25 X-ray brightest MACS clusters we conclude tentatively that negative
evolution is not significant at the highest X-ray luminosities (Lx>10^45 erg/s)
out to redshifts of z~0.4. Our findings thus extend the no-evolution result

is a common mean observed radio luminosity from the black hole candidates

horizontal X-ray branch. This implies a common mean intrinsic radio luminosity
to within a factor of twenty five (or less, if there is significant Doppler

physical mechanism for jet formation which requires neither a black hole event

significantly larger than the binary separations of most of the systems. We

the previous CNO-burning core, and is ejected in the interstellar medium when

value, depending on the metallicity. This prediction is used in conjunction

A's radio lobes. The depressions are nearly devoid of X-ray-emitting gas, and
there is no evidence for shock-heated gas surrounding the radio lobes. We
suggest the gas within the surface brightness depressions was displaced as the
radio lobes expanded subsonically, leaving cavities in the hot atmosphere. The
gas temperature declines from 4 keV at 70 kpc to 3 keV in the inner 20 kpc of
the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and the cooling time of the gas is $\sim
600$ Myr in the inner 10 kpc. These properties are consistent with the presence
of a $\sim 34 \msunyr$ cooling flow within a 70 kpc radius. Bright X-ray
emission is present in the BCG surrounding a recently-accreted disk of nebular

analogous correlations between the structural parameters of their surrounding

galaxy-sized halos in two Cold Dark Matter dominated universes: the standard
Omega=1 CDM scenario and the currently popular LCDM model. We find that the
slope and scatter of the I-band Tully-Fisher relation are well reproduced in
the simulations, although not, as proposed in recent work, as a result of the
cosmological equivalence between halo mass and circular velocity: large
systematic variations in the fraction of baryons that collapse to form galaxies
and in the ratio between halo and disk circular velocities are observed in our
numerical experiments. The Tully-Fisher slope and scatter are recovered in this
model as a direct result of the dynamical response of the halo to the assembly
of the luminous component of the galaxy. We conclude that models that neglect
the self-gravity of the disk and its influence on the detailed structure of the
halo cannot be used to derive meaningful estimates of the scatter or slope of
the Tully-Fisher relation. Our models fail, however, to match the zero-point of
the Tully-Fisher relation, as well as that of the relation linking disk
rotation speed and angular momentum. These failures can be traced,
respectively, to the excessive central concentration of dark halos formed in
the Cold Dark Matter cosmogonies we explore and to the formation of galaxy
disks as the final outcome of a sequence of merger events. (abridged)","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",1.0,11,53,astro-ph

of distance away from the boundary. If a low frequency cut-off is introduced in
the power spectrum of the boundary velocity, the variance decays exponentially
for distances larger than a Stokes layer thickness based on the cut-off
frequency. Vibration of a gently curved boundary results in steady streaming in
the ensemble average of the tangential velocity. Its amplitude diverges
logarithmically with distance away from the boundary, but asymptotes to a
constant value instead if a low frequency cut-off is considered. This steady
component of the velocity is shown to depend logarithmically on the cut-off
frequency. Finally, we consider the case of a periodically modulated solid
boundary that is being randomly vibrated. We find steady streaming in the

the effect of blending, a newly developed method of Differential Image Analysis
(DIA) was proposed for microlensing searches. However, even with the light
variation curve obtained by using the DIA method, dramatic reduction of the
uncertainty in the determined Einstein time scale is not expected due to the
difficulty in determining the baseline flux of a source star.
  However, we show in this paper that if the blending effect is investigated by
detecting the shift of a source star image centroid, the DIA method will allow
one to detect the blending effect with a significantly enhanced efficiency
compared the efficiency of the current method based on PSF photometry (PSF
method). This is because for a given event the centroid shift measurable by
using the DIA method, $\delta\theta_{\rm c,DIA}$, is {\it always} larger than
the centroid shift measurable by using the PSF method, $\delta\theta_{\rm
c,PSF}$. We find that the ratio $\delta\theta_{\rm c,DIA}/\delta\theta_{\rm

addition, for events affected by the same fraction of blended light, the ratio
$\delta\theta_{\rm c,DIA}/ \delta \theta_{\rm c,DIA}$ is larger for the event
with a lower amplification. Therefore, centroid shift measurements by using the
DIA method will be an efficient method to detect the blending effect especially

result of having, at the same time, stars of low-mass which undergo the

clusters are compatible with this interpretation. Similar features can be
produced in theoretical models which assume a non-negligible mass spread for

observed effect is due to the natural mass range of core helium burning stars
found in single isochrones, although present models do not present the level of
detail necessary to completely explore this possibility. Also the possibility
of a large age spread among cluster stars can be refuted on observational
grounds. We then suggest a few alternatives. This spread may be resulting
either from star-to-star variations in the mass-loss rates during the RGB
phase. Alternatively, effects sush as stellar rotation or convective core
overshooting, could be causing a significant spread in the core mass at

phenomenon orientational pinning. This leads to a finite transverse critical
current for a bias at $\phi=0$ and to a transverse voltage for a bias at
$\phi\not=0$. On the other hand, for diagonal bias in the [11] direction the
behavior is highly unstable against small variations of $\phi$, leading to a

relatively high and roughly constant at low frequencies, and begins to drop

beginning and decreases rapidly during the rising phase. Also observed is that

to revisit this issue, as accurate stellar distances make it possible to
compare observed absolute fluxes with the predictions of model atmospheres.
  The near-UV continuum is highly sensitive to Teff and [Fe/H], and once the
gravity is constrained from the parallax, these parameters may be derived from
the analysis of low-dispersion ""long-wavelength"" (2000-3000 A) IUE spectra for
stars previously studied by Alonso et al. (1996; A&AS 117, 227) using the

observed and synthetic fluxes for stars with 4000 <= Teff <= 6000 K of any
metallicity and gravity. These facts suggest that model atmospheres provide an
adequate description of the near-UV continuum forming region and that the
opacities involved are essentially understood. For cooler stars, the results of
the IRFM are no longer reliable, as shown by Alonso et al., but the discrepancy

the most complete and homogeneous metallicity data to date for the RR Lyrae
stars in this cluster. For RR Lyrae stars in common with the Delta-S

consistent with previous spectroscopic measurements. We conclude that this is
due to the larger errors associated with the previous Delta-S observations for
this cluster. The Mv(RR) - [Fe/H] and period-shift - [Fe/H] relations obtained
from our new data are consistent with the evolutionary models predicted by Lee

The 9M CMD reveals a complex superposition of different age and metallicity
stellar populations, with important stellar evolutionary phases occurring over
3 orders of magnitude in number density. First, we count the non-variable
supergiants, the associated Cepheids, and measure the effective temperatures
defining the instability strip. Lifetime predictions of stellar evolution
theory are tested, with implications for the origin of low-luminosity Cepheids.
The highly-evolved AGB stars have a bimodal distribution in brightness, which
we interpret as discrete old populations (>1 Gyr). The faint AGB may be
metal-poor and very old. We identify the clusters NGC 411 and M3 as templates
for the admixture of old stellar populations. However, there are indications
that the old and metal-poor field population has a red HB morphology: the RR
Lyraes lie on the red edge of the instability strip, the AGB-bump is very red,
and the ratio of AGB-bump stars to RR Lyraes is quite large. If the HB second
parameter is age, the old and metal-poor field population likely formed after
the oldest clusters. Lifetime predictions of stellar evolution theory lead us
to associate a significant fraction of the red HB clump giants with the same
old and metal-poor population producing the RR Lyraes and the AGB-bump. In this
case, compared to the age-dependent luminosity predictions of stellar evolution
theory, the red HB clump is too bright relative to the RR Lyraes and AGB-bump.
Last, the surface density profile of RR Lyraes is fit by an exponential,
favoring a disk-like rather than spheroidal distribution. We conclude that the
age of the LMC disk is probably similar to the age of the Galactic disk.

electrons in a spatially inhomogeneous medium in order to interpret the
broad-band nonthermal radiation of the young supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia
A. A two-zone model is proposed that distinguishes between compact, bright
steep-spectrum radio knots and the bright fragmented radio ring on the one
hand, and the remainder of the shell - the diffuse `plateau' - on the other
hand. In the framework of this model it is possible to explain the basic
features of the spectral and temporal evolution of the synchrotron radiation of
Cas A if one assumes that these compact structures correspond to sites of
efficient electron acceleration producing hard spectra of accelerated particles
with power-law indices ~2.2. The resulting energy distribution of radio
electrons in these compact structures becomes significantly steeper than the
electron production spectrum on timescales of the energy dependent escape of
these electrons into the surrounding diffuse plateau region. We argue that the
steepness, rather than the hardness, of the radio spectra of compact bright
structures in clumpy sources can in general be considered as a typical
signature of sites where strong electron acceleration has built up high
gradients in the spatial distribution of radio electrons. Subsequent diffusive
escape then modifies their energy distribution, leading to spatial variations
of spectral indices within the radio source. Qualitative and quantitative
interpretations of a number of observational data of Cas A are given.

more steeply in the inner parts than the HI rotation curves and reach a flat
part beyond about two disk scale lengths. With radii expressed in optical disk
scale lengths, the rotation curves of the low surface brightness galaxies
presented here and those of HSB galaxies have almost identical shapes. Mass
modeling shows that the contribution of the stellar component to the rotation
curves may be scaled to explain most of the inner parts of the rotation curves,

forming the spine and the hard state branches forming the teeth. Variability
was strongly correlated with the position on the branches. The broad band noise
became stronger, and changed from power law like to band limited, as the

the effects of such a modification of the initial power spectrum. While the
halo multiplicity function depends primarily on the linear theory power
spectrum, most other probes of power are more sensitive to the non-linear power
spectrum. Collapse of large-scale structures as they go non-linear regenerates
a ``tail'' in the power spectrum, masking small-scale modifications to the

subject to an uniform shear flow quenched from a disordered to a homogeneous
ordered phase. The kinetics of the process is described in the context of the
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation with an external velocity term. The
large-N approximation is used to study the evolution of the model in the
presence of a stationary flow and in the case of an oscillating shear.
  For stationary flow we show that the structure factor obeys a generalized
dynamical scaling. The domains grow with different typical lengthscales $R_x$
and $R_\perp$ respectively in the flow direction and perpendicularly to it. In
the scaling regime $R_\perp \sim t^{\alpha_\perp}$ and $R_x \sim \gamma
t^{\alpha_x}$ (with logarithmic corrections), $\gamma $ being the shear rate,
with $\alpha_x=5/4$ and $\alpha_\perp =1/4$. The excess viscosity $\Delta \eta$
after reaching a maximum relaxes to zero as $\gamma ^{-2}t^{-3/2}$. $\Delta
\eta$ and other observables exhibit log-time periodic oscillations which can be
interpreted as due to a growth mechanism where stretching and break-up of
domains cyclically occur.
  In the case of an oscillating shear a cross-over phenomenon is observed:
Initially the evolution is characterized by the same growth exponents as for a
stationary flow. For longer times the phase separating structure cannot align
with the oscillating drift and a different regime is entered with an isotropic
growth and the same exponents of the case without shear.","{'term': u'cond-mat', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.5,24,39,cond-mat

detectable by observing the event at late times. Photometric degeneracies

directed percolation and studies their scaling properties, field-theoretic
aspects, numerical techniques, as well as possible experimental realizations.
In addition, several examples of absorbing-state transitions which do not
belong to the directed percolation universality class will be discussed. As a
closely related technique, we investigate the concept of damage spreading. It
is shown that this technique is ambiguous to some extent, making it impossible
to define chaotic and regular phases in stochastic nonequilibrium systems.
Finally, we discuss various classes of depinning transitions in models for
interface growth which are related to phase transitions into absorbing states.","{'term': u'cond-mat.stat-mech', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.0,153,443,cond-mat.stat-mech

describing the physics inside a volume (including gravity) is bounded by the
area of the boundary (also called the screen) which encloses this volume. A
stronger statement is that these (quantum) degrees of freedom live on the
boundary and describe the physics inside the volume completely. The obvious
question is, what mechanism is behind the holographic principle. Recently, 't
Hooft argued that the quantum degrees of freedom on the boundary are not
fundamental. We argue that this interpretation opens up the possibility that
the mapping between the theory in the bulk (the holographic theory) and the
theory on the screen (the dual theory) is always given by a (generalized)
procedure of stochastic quantization. We show that gravity causes differences
to the situation in Minkowski/Euclidean spacetime and argue that the fictitious
coordinate needed in the stochastic quantization procedure can be spatial. The
diffusion coefficient of the stochastic process is in general a function of
this coordinate. While a mapping of a bulk theory onto a (quantum) boundary
theory can be possible, such a mapping does not make sense in spacetimes in
which the area of the screen is growing with time. This is connected to the
average process in the formalism of stochastic quantization. We show where the
stochastic quantization procedure breaks down and argue, in agreement with `t
Hooft, that the quantum degrees of freedom are not fundamental degrees of

composite of a bright Type 1 component and a fainter Type 2 component.
Unresolved soft sources with Type 1 spectra or the soft component of Type 3
spectra are most likely photospheric emission from the hot central stars.
Absorption cross sections are large for these soft-energy photons; therefore,
only large, tenuous, evolved PNs with hot central stars and small absorption
column densities have been detected. The origin of hard X-ray emission from PNs
is uncertain. PNs with Type 2 spectra are small, dense, young nebulae with
relatively cool (<<10^5 K) central stars, while PNs with Type 3 X-ray spectra

the stationary limit for the drift velocities $(\overset{\to

$(\overset{\to}\to{u}\overset{\to}\to{q}/\hbar \omega_q) \geq 1$. It is shown
that the mutual drag of carriers and photons leads to the formation of
''quasi-particles''\_ the ''electron dressed by photons'' and ''positron
dressed by photons'', i.e. the mutual drag plays the role of the dressing
mechanism of carriers and leads to the renormalization of the mass and
frequency of photons.
  As a result of analyses of the phenomena of connected by the mutual drag

finiteness of the mass of photon (i.e. the rest mass of photons do not equal to
zero); b) reality of takhyons as a quasi-particles with the real mass in

the Doppler effect which coincides with the renormalization of frequency or
mass as a result of the mutual drag of carriers and photons at external field

relativistic factor enters to the expressions of the DF of photons and other
physical expressions in the first order in the form $[ 1-(u^2/c^2) ] ^{-1}$,
instead the $[ 1-(u^2/c^2) ] ^{-1/2}$ in Einstein theory. It is shown that the

one in which the mass follows the light (i.e. no dark matter) and one with a
logarithmic gravitational potential. Using chi^2-statistics, we compare our

radial power-law of index p=1.0-2.0 or with a collapse model such as that of
Shu (1997: ApJ, 214, 488). This inside-out collapse model predicts 13CO, C18O,
HCO+, and H13CO+ line profiles which closely match observed spectra toward

a good description of YSO envelopes, but also that reliable constraints on its

structure, e.g., through continuum and line observations. For the remaining

rotating, disk-like structure better describes the data. Possibly, this source
is in transition between the embedded Class I and the optically revealed T

cosmic microwave background, and the original conjecture that the radiation is
from a thermal warm gas at a temperature of $\sim$ 10$^{5-6}$ K. Currently a

gas interpretation. We also argued, based on pressure balance within the

the soft excess radial trend (SERT, which qualitatively means a rising

peaked distribution of cold matter, with Coma having the least effect and no

discussed. All involve the failure of neutrino energy deposition to launch a
strong supernova explosion. A key quantity which determines the type of high
energy transient produced is the ratio of the engine operation time, $\rm
t_{engine}$, to the time for the explosion to break out of the stellar surface,
$\rm t_{bo}$. Stars with sufficient angular momentum produce collapsars --
black holes accreting rapidly through a disk -- in their centers. Collapsars
can occur in stars with a wide range of radii depending on the amount of
pre-collapse mass loss. The stellar radius and jet properties determine the
degree of beaming of the explosion. In some cases the stellar envelope serves
to focus the explosion to narrow beaming angles. The baryon loading of various
models for classical GRBs formed in massive stars is examined and the
consequences are explored. For $\rm t_{engine} > t_{bo}$, highly relativistic
outflow is possible and classical GRBs accompanied by supernovae can be
produced. In other cases hyper-energetic, asymmetric supernovae are produced.

coupled time-dependent Schroedinger equations for the modes of the scalar field

further controlled gaussian approximation of our tdHF approach is used in order
to study the dynamical evolution of the system from non-equilibrium initial

``stopping at the spinodal line'' of the quantum fluctuations. We also study

strong-coupling bandwidth of order J (for the NN hopping model) and band gap of

opens) only if same sublattice hopping (e.g., NNN hopping) is also present, and
the correct integrated spectral weights (1/2 per spin) in each band for the

twisting due to finite spin correlation length, are investigated with a static,

the hopping term at first order resulting in band broadening, and the

  Removing the inner, most unstable parts of the accretion disc increases the
predicted recurrence times. However, DIMs with values of the viscosity
parameter alpha_hot ~ 0.1 and alpha_cold ~ 0.02 (typical of applications of the
DIM to standard dwarf nova outbursts) fail to reproduce the long recurrence
times of SXTs (unless we resort to fine-tuning of the parameters) independent
of the evaporation strength. We show that models with evaporation and a smaller
value of alpha_cold (~ 0.005) do reproduce the long recurrence times and the
accretion rates at the level of the Eddington rate observed in outburst. The
large difference between the values of alpha_hot and alpha_cold, if confirmed
when disc irradiation is included, suggests that several viscosity mechanisms
operate in these accretion discs.
  For some choices of parameters our models predict reflares during the decline
from outburst. They are a physical property of the model and result from a
heating front forming in the wake of an initial cooling front and subsequent,
multiple front reflections. The reflares disappear in low-alpha models where

doping dependence of the flatness of the gap near the nodes is also

bursts from six low-mass X-ray binaries has provided a powerful new tool to
study the properties of matter at supranuclear densities, the effects of strong
gravity, and the propagation of thermonuclear burning. There is substantial
evidence that these brightness oscillations are produced by spin modulation of
one or two localized hot spots confined to the stellar surface. It is therefore
important to calculate the expected light curves produced by such hot spots
under various physical assumptions, so that comparison with the observed light
curves may most sensitively yield information about the underlying physical
quantities. In this paper we make general relativistic calculations of the
light curves and oscillation amplitudes produced by a rotating neutron star
with one or two hot spots as a function of spot size, stellar compactness,
rotational velocity at the stellar surface, spot location, orientation of the
line of sight of the observer, and the angular dependence of the surface
specific intensity. We find that stellar rotation and beaming of the emission
tend to increase the observed oscillation amplitudes whereas greater
compactness and larger spot size tend to decrease them. By applying these
results to 4U 1636--536, we show that this source must have two emitting spots

(DNLS) is our main objective, but its so called modified discrete nonlinear
(MDNLS) version is also included, together with the fermionic polaron (FP)
model. Based on the respective dynamical symmetries of the models, a method is
put forward which by use of the associated boson and spin coherent state
vectors (CSV) and a factorization ansatz for the solution of the Schroedinger
equation, leads to quasiclassical Hamiltonian equations of motion for the CSV
parameters. Analysing the geometrical content of the factorization ansatz made
for the state vectors invokes the study of the Riemannian and symplectic
geometry of the CSV manifolds as generalized phase spaces. Next, we investigate
analytically and numerically the behavior of mean values and uncertainties of
some physically interesting observables as well as the modifications in the
quantum regime of processes such as the discrete self trapping (DST), in terms
of the Q-function and the distribution of excitation quanta of the lattice
sites. Quantum DST in the symmetric ordering of lattice operators is found to
be relatively enhanced with respect to the classical DST. Finally, the meaning
of the factorization ansatz for the lattice wave function is explained in terms
of disregarded quantum correlations, and as a quantitative figure of merit for
that ansatz a correlation index is introduced.","{'term': u'quant-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.5,27,52,quant-ph

then the emission line fluxes can be reproduced well by a simple
photoionization model using a central power law continuum source with a

formation history (SFH) of galaxies. The evolution of the star formation
activity is followed on a wide range of redshifts (0< z < 4) covering most of
the history of the Universe. Two incompatible interpretations of the
observations are currently competing. After applying star formation rate (SFR)
conversion factors to the CFRS, Halpha or ISO samples, many authors conclude to
a strong increase (~ a factor 10) of the SFR from z=0 to z=1. They also find
some evidence for a peak at z~1 and for a rapid decrease at higher redshifts.
On the other side, the Hawaii deep surveys favor only a mild increase between
z=0 and 1 (Cowie et al., 1996, 1999). To understand the reason for these
discrepant interpretations, we consider three classes of galaxies: E/S0,
Sa-Sb-Sbc, Sc-Sd-Im and bursting dwarfs. We use the new version of our
evolutionary synthesis code, PEGASE which takes into account metallicity and
dust effects. The main results are: i) Late-type galaxies contribute
significantly to the local SFR, especially bursting dwarfs (Fioc and
Rocca-Volmerange, 1999). Because of that, the cosmic SFR can not decrease by a
factor 10 from z=0 to 1. This is in agreement with Cowie's result. ii) The SFR
of intermediate-type galaxies has strongly decreased since z=1. Though the
decrease is less than what find Lilly et al., 1996, this suggests that the CFRS
and Halpha surveys are dominated by such bright early spirals. iii) The
contribution of early-type galaxies increases rapidly from z=1 to their
redshift of formation (> 2-3 for cosmological reasons). Their intense star

the higher end of our mass range, but becomes negligible below 0.4 M_sun.
Formulae for relating T_eff to mass and v_rot are presented.
  We compare our models to rotational data from young open clusters of
different ages to infer the rotational history of low mass stars, and the
dependence of initial conditions and rotational evolution on mass. We find that
the qualitative conclusions for stars below 0.6 M_sun do not depend on the
assumptions about internal angular momentum transport, which makes these low
mass stars ideal candidates for the study of the angular momentum loss law and
distribution of initial conditions. We find that neither models with solid body
nor differential rotation can simultaneously reproduce the observed stellar
spin down in the 0.6 to 1.1 M_sun mass range and for stars between 0.1 and 0.6
M_sun. The most likely explanation is that the saturation threshold drops more
steeply at low masses than would be predicted with a simple Rossby scaling. In
young clusters there is a systematic increase in the mean rotation rate with
decreased temperature below 3500 K (0.4 M_sun). This suggests either
inefficient angular momentum loss or mass-dependent initial conditions for
stars near the fully convective boundary. (abridged)","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.5,40,71,astro-ph

can drive parametric resonance instabilities. We discuss several phenomena
stemming from such instabilities, especially in weak-scale models; generically,
these involve energizing a resonant system so that it can evade tunneling by
crossing barriers classically. One possibility is a spontaneous change of phase
from a lower-energy vacuum state to one of higher energy, as exemplified by an
asymmetric double-well potential with different masses in each well. If the
lower well is in resonance with oscillations of the potential, a system can be
driven resonantly to the upper well and stay there (except for tunneling) if
the upper well is not resonant. Another example occurs in hybrid inflation
models where the Higgs field is resonant; the Higgs oscillations can be
transferred to electroweak (EW) gauge potentials, leading to rapid transitions
over sphaleron barriers and consequent B+L violation. Given an appropriate
CP-violating seed, we find that preheating can drive a time-varying condensate
of Chern-Simons number over large spatial scales; this condensate evolves by
oscillation as well as decay into modes with shorter spatial gradients,
eventually ending up as a condensate of sphalerons. We study these examples
numerically and to some extent analytically. The emphasis in the present paper
is on the generic mechanisms, and not on specific preheating models; these will

studied in molecular lines and centimeter radio continuum. All the sources have
IRAS colours typical of very young stellar objects (YSOs) and are associated
with dense gas. In spite of their high luminosities (L>10000 solar units), only
ten of these sources are also associated with a radio counterpart. In 17 cases
we could identify a clear peak of millimeter emission associated with the IRAS
source, while in 9 sources the millimeter emission was extended or faint and a
clear peak could not be identified; upper limits were found in 4 cases only.
  Using simple greybody fitting model to the observed SED, we derive global
properties of the circumstellar dust. The dust temperature varies from 24 K to
45 K, while the exponent of the dust emissivity vs frequency power-law spans a
range 1.56<beta<2.38, characteristic of silicate dust; total circumstellar
masses range up to more than 500 solar masses.
  We find that for sources with comparable luminosities, the total column
densities derived from the dust masses do not distinguish between sources with
and without radio counterpart. We interpret this result as an indication that
dust does not play a dominant role in inhibiting the formation of the HII
region. We examine several scenarios for their origin in terms of newborn ZAMS
stars and although most of these fail to explain the observations, we cannot
exclude that these sources are young stars already on the ZAMS with modest
residual accretion that quenches the expansion of the HII region. Finally, we
consider the possibility that the IRAS sources are high-mass pre-ZAMS (or

the best-studied starburst galaxy M82. We study how the wind dynamics,
morphology and X-ray emission depend on the host galaxy's ISM distribution,
starburst star formation history and strength, and presence and distribution of
mass-loading by dense clouds. We find that the soft X-ray emission from
galactic winds comes from low filling factor (ff < 2 per cent) gas, which
contains only a small fraction (f < 10 per cent) of the mass and energy of the
wind, irrespective of whether the wind models are strongly mass-loaded or not.
X-ray observations of galactic winds therefore do not directly probe the gas
that contains the majority of the energy, mass or metal-enriched gas in the
outflow. The soft X-ray emission comes from gas at a wide range different
temperatures and densities. Estimates of the physical properties of the hot gas
in starburst galaxies, based on fitting the standard simple spectral models to
existing X-ray spectra, should therefore be treated with extreme suspicion. The
majority of the thermal and kinetic energy of these winds is in a volume
filling hot, T approx 10^7 K, component which is extremely difficult to probe
observationally due to its low density and hence low emissivity. Most of the
total energy is in the kinetic energy of this hot gas, a factor which must be
taken into account when attempting to constrain wind energetics
observationally. We also find that galactic winds are efficient at transporting
large amounts of energy out of the host galaxy, in contrast to their
inefficiency at transporting mass out of star-forming galaxies. (Abridged)","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",1.0,38,105,astro-ph

amplitude. Our observation of negative compressibility in the under-doped

On this scheme, a Monte Carlo event generator (BABAYAGA) is developed for data
analysis. To test the reliability of the approach, a benchmark calculation,
including exact O(alpha) corrections and higher-order leading logarithmic
contributions, is developed as well, implemented in a Monte Carlo integrator
(LABSPV) and compared in detail with the BABAYAGA predictions. The effect of
initial-state and final-state radiation, O(alpha) next-to-leading and
higher-order leading corrections is investigated and discussed in the presence
of realistic event selections. The theoretical precision of BABAYAGA is
estimated to be at the 0.5% level.","{'term': u'hep-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.25,8,21,hep-ph

an apparent discrepancy between terms that depend logarithmically on the

identified, and its effect on the maximal value of the lightest CP-even Higgs

be absorbed to a large extent into an effective one-loop expression by
evaluating the running top quark mass at appropriately chosen energy scales.","{'term': u'hep-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.2,29,39,hep-ph

contact coordination number. The approximation of small displacements (ASD)
allows to draw analogies with other model systems studied in statistical
mechanics, such as minimum paths on a lattice. It also entails the uniqueness
of the equilibrium state (the list of contacts itself is geometrically
determined) for cohesionless grains, and thus the absence of plastic
dissipation. Plasticity and hysteresis are due to the lack of such uniqueness
and may stem, apart from intergranular friction, from small, but finite,
rearrangements, in which the system jumps between two distinct potential energy
minima, or from bounded tensile contact forces. The response to load increments
is discussed. On the basis of past numerical studies, we argue that, if the ASD
is valid, the macroscopic displacement field is the solution to an elliptic
boundary value problem (akin to the Stokes problem).","{'term': u'cond-mat.soft', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.0,40,61,cond-mat.soft

explained by a superposition of the radiation of the aging relativistic
particle population left behind by the shocks. This scenario is the low energy,
time-resolved equivalent to the internal shock model for GRBs. We show that
this model predicts energy contents of the radiating plasma similar to the
plasmon model. At the same time, the jet model relaxes the severe requirements
on the central source in terms of the rate at which this energy must be
supplied to the jet. Observations of `mini-bursts' with flat spectral slopes
and of infrared emission far from the source centre suggest two different
states of jet ejections: (i) A `mini-burst' mode with relatively stable jet
production and weak radio emission with flat spectra and (ii) an outburst mode
with strong variations in the jet bulk velocities coupled with strong radio
emission with steeper spectra. We also show that the continuous jets in
microquasars should terminate in strong shocks and possibly inflate radio lobes
similar to extragalactic jet sources. Finally, we investigate the possibility

with remote astrophysical loads, the rotational energy of the black hole can be
extracted through the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. Due to the rotation of the
black hole, the magnetic field lines are twisted and toroidal components are
generated. So poloidal electric currents are induced and the black hole's
rotational energy is transported to the astrophysical loads through Poynting
flux. The Blandford-Znajek mechanism has been considered to be a possible
process for powering extragalactic jets.
  In this paper we show that due to the screw instability of magnetic field,
the toroidal components of the magnetic field, and thus the poloidal currents,
cannot exceed the limits given by the Kruskal-Shafranov criterion. This
significantly lowers the power of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism when the loads
are far from the black hole. So the Blandford-Znajek mechanism can only work
efficiently within the neighborhood of the black hole. The implications of the

cosmological ionization fronts, using new simulations of the reionization of
the universe by stars in protogalaxies. Two mechanisms are primarily
responsible for magnetogenesis: i) the breakout of I-fronts from protogalaxies,
and ii) the propagation of I-fronts through the high density neutral filaments
which are part of the cosmic web. The first mechanism is dominant prior to
overlapping of ionized regions (z ~ 7), whereas the second continues to operate
even after that epoch. However, after overlap the field strength increase is
largely due to the gas compression occurring as cosmic structures form. As a
consequence, the magnetic field at z ~ 5 closely traces the gas density, and it
is highly ordered on megaparsec scales. The mean mass-weighted field strength
is B_0 ~ 10^{-19} G in the simulation box. There is a relatively well-defined,
nearly linear correlation between B_0 and the baryonic mass of virialized
objects, with B_0 ~ 10^{-18} G in the most massive objects (M ~ 10^9 M_sun) in
our simulations. This is a lower limit, as lack of numerical resolution
prevents us from following small scale dynamical processes which could amplify
the field in protogalaxies. Although the field strengths we compute are
probably adequate as seed fields for a galactic dynamo, the field is too small
to have had significant effects on galaxy formation, on thermal conduction, or
on cosmic ray transport in the intergalactic medium. It could, however, be
observed in the intergalactic medium through innovative methods based on
analysis of gamma-ray burst photon arrival times.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.5,21,51,astro-ph

important role in explosive burning. Electron capture affects the central

measurement of the unstable system does not affect its exponential decay to a

distribution of the tunneling electron, however, is not equal to the inverse

have smaller disks than normal galaxies, and that the disks of unbarred

zero normal scattering) at the Fermi energy can only be achieved by fine-tuning
junction parameters. We also obtain exact results for the Josephson current,
which is generally a smooth function of the superconducting phase difference
except when the junction parameters are adjusted to give perfect Andreev
scattering, in which case it becomes a sawtooth function. We then observe that,
even when interactions are included, all low energy properties of a junction
(E<<\Delta, the superconducting gap) can be obtained by ""integrating out"" the
superconducting electrons to obtain an effective Hamiltonian describing the
metallic electrons only with a boundary pairing interaction. This boundary
model provides a suitable starting point for bosonization/renormalization
group/boundary conformal field theory analysis. We argue that total normal
reflection and total Andreev reflection correspond to two fixed points of the
boundary renormalization group. For repulsive bulk interactions the Andreev
fixed point is unstable and the normal one stable. However, the reverse is true
for attractive interactions. This implies that a generic junction Hamiltonian
(without fine-tuned junction parameters) will renormalize to the normal fixed
point for repulsive interactions but to the Andreev one for attractive
interactions. An exact mapping of our tight-binding model to the Hubbard model

flows (ADAFs) require the presence of strong winds are unfounded because they
assume that low radiative efficiency in flows accreting at low rates onto black
holes implies vanishing radial energy and angular momentum fluxes through the

positive). This, however, is a property only of self-similar solutions which
are an inadequate representation of global accretion flows. We recall general
properties of accretion flows onto black holes and show that such, necessarily
transonic, flows may have either positive or negative Bernoulli function
depending on the flow viscosity. Flows with low viscosities (alpha<0.1 in the
alpha-viscosity model) have a negative Bernoulli function. Without exception,
all 2-D and 1-D numerical models of low viscosity flows constructed to date
experience no significant outflows. At high viscosities the presence of
outflows depends on the assumed viscosity, the equation of state and on the
outer boundary condition. The positive sign of the Bernoulli function invoked
in this context is irrelevant to the presence of outflows. As an illustration,
we recall 2-D numerical models with moderate viscosity that have positive
values of the Bernoulli function and experience no outflows. ADAFs, therefore,
do not differ from this point of view from thin Keplerian discs: they may have,
but they do not have to have strong winds.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.5,7,42,astro-ph

obtained; they are represented by superpositions of power laws with

leading contributions to the even correlation functions are given by the
exponents from the isotropic shell, in agreement with the idea of restored
small-scale isotropy. Conversely, the small-scale anisotropy reveals itself in
the odd correlation functions : the skewness factor is slowly decreasing going

the X-ray source, under the assumption that the X-ray flux is absorbed and

the expected continuum UV emission as a function of time at several wavelengths

space of black hole masses and observer azimuthal angles but we were unable to
reproduce UV light curves which would resemble, even remotely, those observed.
We also explored whether particular combinations of the values of these

autocorrelation and cross correlation functions) would match those
corresponding to the observed UV light curve at \l \l 1315 \AA. Even though we

shells found in several planetary nebulae (PNs) and proto-PNs, and around one

the progenitor AGB stars. The time intervals between consecutive ejection
events is about 200-1,000 years, which is assumed to be the cycle period (the
full magnetic cycle can be twice as long, as is the 22-year period in the sun).
The magnetic field has no dynamical effects; it regulates the mass loss rate by
the formation of magnetic cool spots. The enhanced magnetic activity at the
cycle maximum results in more magnetic cool spots, which facilitate the
formation of dust, hence increasing the mass loss rate. The strong magnetic
activity implies that the AGB star is spun up by a companion, via a tidal or
common envelope interaction. The strong interaction with a stellar companion
explains the observations that the concentric semi-periodic shells are found
mainly in bipolar PNs.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.0,13,35,astro-ph

  The oxygen abundance gradients are steeper than in normal barred galaxies,
while the intersects are low. This excludes the possibility that these are
chemically evolved galaxies rejuvenated by the effect of a bar. The
nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance gradients are flatter than the oxygen ones. But
N/O intersects are high, which rules out the possibility that a large quantity
of gas was recently funneled by a bar toward the center of a young galaxy.
Bars, therefore, cannot be at the origin of the bursts in the nuclei of our
sample galaxies.
  The oxygen and N/O abundance gradients are generally stronger in the bar than
in the disk and are linked together by a linear relation. This can be fully
explained in terms of star formation history: the gradients build up from the
inside out, becoming stronger as the oxygen and N/O abundances increase in the
bulge while staying low in the disk.
  In many of the sample galaxies, star formation occurs at one or both ends of
the bar. The low level of chemical enrichment in these regions suggests that
they recently experienced bar-triggered star formation: this is the only

magnetospheric accretion model predictions. Observational evidence previously

the relation between different line forming regions and search for good
accretion rate indicators.
  In this work we confirm several important points of the models, such as the
correlation between accretion and outflow, broad emission components that are
mostly central or slightly blueshifted and only the occasional presence of
redshifted absorption. We also show, however, that the broad emission
components supposedly formed in the magnetospheric accretion flow only
partially support the models. Unlike the predictions, they are sometimes
redshifted, and are mostly found to be symmetric. The published theoretical
profiles do not have a strong resemblance to our observed ones. We emphasize
the need for accretion models to include a strong turbulent component before
their profiles will match the observations. The effects of rotation, and the
outflow components, will also be needed to complete the picture.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",1.0,31,43,astro-ph

dependent on the convection as parametrized by the mixing length theory. When
one of the methods is applied to the gamma Dor stars gives phase lags close to

The star formation rate is calculated using a Lagrangian Schmidt Law for all

Feedback is incorporated as thermal heating of the ISM. We compare the effects
of distributing this energy over the smoothing scale or depositing it on a
single particle. Radiative losses are prevented from heated particles by
adjusting the density used in radiative cooling. We test the models on the
formation of galaxies from cosmological initial conditions and also on isolated
Milky Way and dwarf galaxies. Extremely violent feedback is necessary to
produce a gas disk with angular momentum remotely close to that of observed
disk galaxies. This is a result of the extreme central concentration of the
dark halos in the sCDM model, and the pervasiveness of the core-halo angular
momentum transport mechanism. We emphasize that the disks formed in
hierarchical simulations are partially a numerical artifact produced by the
minimum mass scale of the simulation acting as a highly efficient `support'
mechanism. Disk formation is strongly affected by the treatment of dense
regions in SPH, which along with the difficulty of representing the
hierarchical formation process, means that realistic simulations of galaxy

summing over a class of piece-wise linear geometries. This method of
``dynamical triangulations'' is very powerful in 2d, where the regularized

to relate the equations of Boltzmann and Vlasov to the dynamics of

the stochastic independence of two random particles in a many-particle system,
persists in time, as the number of particles tends to infinity.
  We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a family of general
n-particle Markov processes to propagate chaos. This condition is expressed in
terms of the Markov transition functions associated to the n-particle
processes, and it amounts to saying that chaos of random initial states
propagates if it propagates for pure initial states.
  Our proof of this result relies on the weak convergence approach to the study
of chaos due to Sznitman and Tanaka. We assume that the space in which the
particles live is homeomorphic to a complete and separable metric space so that
we may invoke Prohorov's theorem in our proof.
  We also show that, if the particles can be in only finitely many states, then
molecular chaos implies that the specific entropies in the n-particle

the past few years it has been speculated that the discrepancy between theory
and experiment might be due to Delta(1232) related effects, which are only
included via higher order contact interactions in the standard chiral approach.
In this report we demonstrate that this speculation does not hold true. We show
that contrary to expectations from naive dimensional analysis isobar effects on
the photon spectrum and the total rate in radiative muon capture are of the
order of a few percent, consistent with earlier findings in a more
phenomenological approach. We further demonstrate that both ordinary and
radiative muon capture constitute systems with a very well behaved chiral
expansion, both in standard chiral perturbation theory and in the small scale
expansion, and present some new ideas that might be at the bottom of the still
unresolved discrepancy between theory and experiment in radiative muon capture.
Finally we comment upon the procedure employed by the TRIUMF group to extract
new information from their radiative muon capture experiment on the

can be adequately reproduced. We associate this feature, a bifurcation of the
observed elemental ratios into two branches in the Mg abundance interval -2.7 <
[Mg/H] < -2.3, with two distinct processes. The first branch, which we call the
``y''-branch, is associated with the production of Ba and Mg from individual
massive supernovae. We conclude that SNe II with Mms = 20 Msun are the dominant
source of r-process nucleosynthesis in the early Galaxy. An SN-induced chemical
evolution model with this Mms-dependent Ba yield creates the y-branch,
reflecting the different nucleosynthesis yields of [Ba/Mg] for each SN II with
Mms > 20 Msun. The second branch, which we call the ``i''-branch, is associated
with the elemental abundance ratios of stars which were formed in the dense
shells of the interstellar medium swept up by SNe II with Mms < 20 Msun that do
not synthesize r-process elements, and applies to stars with observed Mg
abundances in the range [Mg/H] < -2.7. The Ba abundances in these stars reflect
those of the interstellar gas at the (later) time of their formation. The
existence of a [Ba/Mg] i-branch strongly suggests that SNe II which are
associated with stars of progenitor mass Mms < 20 Msun are infertile sources
for the production of r-process elements. We predict the existence of this
i-branch for other r-process elements, such as europium (Eu), to the extent

producing modulations in the inner disk properties at these characteristic
frequencies. We postulate that a transition radius exists in the accretion disk
close to the compact object and investigate its response to a broad spectrum of
density fluctuations. We find that the transition radius acts as a low
band-pass filter with a broadband response that is constant at frequencies
lower than the inverse radial drift timescale and decreases above it as the
inverse of the frequency. Moreover, the response shows strong resonances at
frequencies nearly equal to the orbital, periastron-precession, and
nodal-precession frequencies, thereby accounting for the observed power-density
spectra of accreting compact objects and the correlations between their
characteristic frequencies.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",1.0,21,54,astro-ph

objects such as black holes and neutron stars, and study the structure of
warped discs produced by the Bardeen-Petterson effect. We calculate the
transition radius out to which the disc specific angular momentum vector is
aligned with that of the black hole. We focus on the parameter regime where the
warp dynamics are controlled by bending wave propagation, but also consider
models in which warps are subject to diffusion rather than wave transport, and
are able to consider the fully nonlinear regime. Because of hydrodynamic or
pressure effects, for the parameter range investigated, the transition radius
is always found to be much smaller than that obtained by Bardeen & Petterson
(1975). For discs with midplane Mach numbers of about 10, the transition occurs
between 10 - 16 gravitational radii, whereas for a Mach number of about 30 it
occurs at around 30 gravitational radii. A thicker disc with a Mach number of 5
is found to produce no discernible warped structure. The rate of black hole -
disc alignment is found to be consistent with the ideas of Ress (1978), with
the alignment torque behaving as if it arises from the accreted material
transferring its misaligned component of angular momentum at the larger
transition radius of Bardeen & Petterson (1975). The inclusion of Einstein
precession in the calculations modified both the warped disc structure and,
consistent with linear analysis, produced an increased alignment rate by up to
a factor of 4 because of the effect that a non Keplerian potential has on the
propagation of warps.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",1.0,18,21,astro-ph

(45--140 keV) as measured by BATSE. This provided a spectrum of Cygnus X-1 in
its canonical low X-ray state (as measured at energies below 10 keV), covering
the energy range from 50 keV to 5 MeV. Here we report on a comparison of this

{\it decreases} during the high X-ray state, the flux at energies above 1 MeV
{\it increases}, resulting in a significantly harder high energy spectrum. This

transport over static flows consisting of two length scales; one varying
smoothly on the wavelength scale, the other varying on a scale comparable to
the wavelength. The spatially rapidly varying but weak surface flows augment
the characteristic equations with scattering terms that are explicit functions
of the correlations of the random surface currents. These scattering terms
depend parametrically on the magnitudes and directions of the smoothly varying
drift and are shown to give rise to a Doppler coupled scattering mechanism. The
Doppler interaction in the presence of slowly varying drift modifies the
scattering processes and provides a mechanism for coupling long wavelengths
with short wavelengths. Conservation of wave action (CWA), typically derived
for slowly varying drift, is extended to systems with rapidly varying flow. At
yet larger propagation distances, we derive from the transport equations, an
equation for wave energy diffusion. The associated diffusion constant is also

mostly composed of a population of distant ultraluminous infrared galaxies, but
identifying the optical/NIR counterparts to these sources has proved difficult
due to the poor submm spatial resolution. However, the proportionality of both
cm and submm data to the star formation rate suggests that high resolution
radio continuum maps with subarcsecond positional accuracy can be exploited to
locate submm sources. In this paper we present results from a targeted SCUBA
survey of micro-Jansky radio sources in the flanking fields of the Hubble Deep
Field. Even with relatively shallow 850-micron SCUBA observations (>6 mJy at
3-sigma), we were successful at making submm detections of optical/NIR-faint
(I>24 and K~21-22) radio sources, and our counts closely match the bright
counts from submm surveys. Redshift estimates can be made from the ratio of the
submm flux to the radio flux across the 100 GHz break in the spectral energy
distribution. This millimetric redshift estimation places the bright submm
population at z=1-3 where it forms the high redshift tail of the faint radio
population. The star formation rate density (SFRD) due to ultraluminous
infrared galaxies increases by more than two orders of magnitude from z~0 to
z~1-3. The SFRD at high redshift inferred from our >6 mJy submm observations is
comparable to that observed in the UV/optical. (Abridged)","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.5,20,118,astro-ph

seven simulation runs with different assumptions on the thermal state of the

decoupling the cooled gas particles from the hot gas particles. All the

simulated clusters are quite sensitive to the thermal history and also to the
numerical resolution of the simulations, and thus are not reliable. On the
other hand, the mass-temperature relation for the simulated clusters is fairly
insensitive to the assumptions of the thermal state of the intracluster gas,
robust against the numerical resolution, and in fact agrees well with the

this source is adequate to account for the observed ionization so there is no
need to find ways to transport stellar photons from the disk. The flux from
cooling SNRs sets a floor on the ionization along any line of sight. Our model
flux is also shown to be consistent with the diffuse soft X-ray background and
with soft X-ray observations of external galaxies.

even faint gas excitation emission lines, including 8 and 11 H_2 lines in the

molecules indicate that most of the 1-0S(1) in each of the nuclei has a thermal
origin. We discuss this with reference to the observed morphologies, especially
that of the 1-0S(1) line. In particular, the core of 1-0S(1) in the NE nucleus
is more compact than the 2um continuum; while in the SW nucleus the 1-0S(1) is
significantly offset by 500pc from the continuum (and other) emission. Lastly
we address the issue of the region midway between the two nuclei, where
previously a strong source of radio continuum has been observed. These results
are set in the context of interacting galaxies where shock excited emission
might be expected to occur as a direct consequence of the interaction.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.5,32,75,astro-ph

can make them dominate the flux in some energy ranges. We argue that clustering
in the arrival directions of UHECRs of comparable energy may be due to magnetic
lensing around caustics. We show that magnetic lensing can also significantly
alter the observed composition of cosmic rays at the highest energies. We also

the most reasonable model for the absorber is collisionally ionized gas at
temperatures T=10^{5-6} K with most of the absorption arising from ionized
states of oxygen but with a significant contribution from carbon and nitrogen.
The soft X-ray emission of this warm gas can explain the sub-Galactic column
densities of cold gas inferred within the central regions of most of the
systems. Attributing the absorption to ionized gas reconciles the large columns
of cold H and He inferred from EINSTEIN and ASCA with the lack of such columns
inferred from ROSAT. Within the central ~10-20 kpc, where the constraints are
most secure, the estimated mass of the ionized absorber is consistent with most
(perhaps all) of the matter deposited by a cooling flow over the lifetime of
the flow. Since the warm absorber produces no significant H or He absorption
the large absorber masses are consistent with the negligible atomic and
molecular H inferred from HI and CO observations of cooling flows. It is also
found that if T > ~2x10^5 K then the optical and UV emission implied by the
warm gas does not violate published constraints. Finally, we discuss how the

power-law PDSs are displayed by the longest bursts (T_90>100 s) in which the
range of self-similar time scales covers more than 2 decades. Shorter bursts
have apparent PDS slopes more strongly affected by statistical fluctuations.
The underlying power law can then be reproduced with high accuracy by averaging
the PDSs for a large sample of bursts. This power law has a slope approximately
equal to -5/3 and a sharp break at about 1 Hz.
  The power-law PDS provides a new sensitive tool for studies of GRBs. In
particular, we calculate the PDSs of bright bursts in separate energy channels.
The PDS flattens in the hard channel (h\nu>300 keV) and steepens in the soft
channel (h\nu<50 keV), while the PDS of bolometric light curves approximately
follows the -5/3 law.
  We then study dim bursts and compare them to the bright ones. We find a
strong correlation between the burst brightness and the PDS slope. This
correlation shows that the bursts are far from being standard candles and dim
bursts should be intrinsically weak. The time dilation of dim bursts is
probably related to physical processes occurring in the burst rather than to a

emission from dust injected by sources inside the core region of the Virgo
cluster is a factor of 10 below the detection limit of currently available
telescopes. The outer regions of dynamically young clusters like the Virgo
cluster have a further potential source of intracluster grains since they are
still accreting freshly infalling spiral galaxies which are presumably
contained in an accreting intergalactic medium (IGM). We show that cosmic ray
driven winds from the infalling spirals can inject grains into a subvirial IGM
that is external to the observed X-ray-emitting ICM. Sputtering during the
injection process and in the IGM is weak, so that the injected grains should
accumulate in the IGM until the infall brings them into contact with the hot
ICM. This effect dominates the dust injection rate from known sources embedded
in the hot Virgo ICM. Thus, any detection of diffuse IR emission would probe
the current dust accretion rate for the cluster, acting as an indicator of the
youth and the dynamical state of the cluster. The predictions for the Virgo
cluster are generalised to other clusters and the possibility of detection of
dynamically young clusters at cosmological distances is discussed.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.3333333333333333,19,82,astro-ph

seen between ~ 0.2 and 0.3, when Smail at al. (1998) x-ray clusters are added

steep that the dilaton field tends to overrun the correct minimum and to evolve
to an observationally unacceptable vacuum. We show that the dilaton coupling to

Observed spiral galaxies are spread on a plane in the
three-dimensionallogarithmic space of luminosity L, radius R and rotation
velocity V. The plane is expressed as $L \propto (V R)^{\alpha}$ in I-passband,
where $\alpha$ is a constant. On the plane, observed galaxies are distributed
in an elongated region which looks like the shape of a surfboard. The
well-known scaling relations, L-V (Tully-Fisher relation), V-R (also the
Tully-Fisher relation) and R-L (Freeman's law), can be understood as oblique
projections of the surfboard-like plane into 2-D spaces. This unified
interpretation of the known scaling relations should be a clue to understand
the physical origin of all the relations consistently. Furthermore, this
interpretation can also explain why previous studies could not find any
correlation between TF residuals and radius.
  In order to clarify the origin of this plane, we simulate formation and
evolution of spiral galaxies with the N-body/SPH method, including cooling,
star formation and stellar feedback. Initial conditions are set to isolated 14
spheres with two free parameters, such as mass and angular momentum. The CDM
(h=0.5, $\Omega_0=1$) cosmology is considered as a test case. The simulations
provide the following two conclusions: (a) The slope of the plane is well
reproduced but the zero-point is not. This zero-point discrepancy could be
solved in a low density ($\Omega_0<1$) and high expansion (h>0.5) cosmology.
(b) The surfboard-shaped plane can be explained by the control of galactic mass
and angular momentum.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.5,6,63,astro-ph

spectral ages give meaningful estimates of dynamical ages only when these ages
are << 10^7 years. In juxtaposing the fleeting radiative lifetimes with source
ages which are significantly longer, a refinement of the paradigm for radio
source evolution is required. The changing spectra along lobes are explained,
not predominantly by synchrotron ageing but, by gentle gradients in a magnetic
field mediated by a low-gamma matrix which illuminates an energy-distribution
of particles, controlled largely by classical synchrotron loss in the high
magnetic field of the hotspot. The energy in the particles is an order of
magnitude higher than that inferred from the minimum-energy estimate, implying
that the jet-power is of the same order as the accretion luminosity produced by
the quasar central engine. This refined paradigm points to a resolution of the
findings of Rudnick et al (1994) and Katz-Stone & Rudnick (1994) that both the
Jaffe-Perola and Kardashev-Pacholczyk model spectra are invariably poor
descriptions of the curved spectral shape of lobe emission, and indeed that for

Presently, there is a resurgence of interest in it, mainly for two reasons: (i)
Experimental investigations are under way with ever increasing precision, be it
in the laboratory or by observing outer space. (ii) One desires to test out
alternatives to Einstein's gravitational theory, in particular those of a
gauge-theoretical nature, like Einstein-Cartan theory or metric-affine gravity.
A clean discussion requires a reflection on the foundations of electrodynamics.
If one bases electrodynamics on the conservation laws of electric charge and
magnetic flux, one finds Maxwell's equations expressed in terms of the
excitation H=(D,H) and the field strength F=(E,B) without any intervention of
the metric or the linear connection of spacetime. In other words, there is
still no coupling to gravity. Only the constitutive law H= functional(F)
mediates such a coupling. We discuss the different ways of how metric,
nonmetricity, torsion, and curvature can come into play here. Along the way, we
touch on non-local laws (Mashhoon), non-linear ones (Born-Infeld,
Heisenberg-Euler, Plebanski), linear ones, including the Abelian axion (Ni),
and find a method for deriving the metric from linear electrodynamics (Toupin,
Schoenberg). Finally, we discuss possible non-minimal coupling schemes.","{'term': u'gr-qc', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",1.0,26,95,gr-qc

approximate classical data using states in which appropriate macroscopic

and would undergo the initial starburst. The pancake possibly evolves into a
virialized system in a dissipationless fashion. Consequently, this leads to the
dissipationless galaxy formation at $3\lsim z_c \lsim 10$. A cloud less massive
than $M_{\rm SB}$ cannot cool by H$_2$ emission shortly after the pancake
collapse, but could cool in the course of shrinking to the rotation barrier.
This is likely to lead to the dissipational galaxy formation at relatively low
redshifts as $0\lsim z_c \lsim 4$. The present results provide a solid physical
mechanism which controls the star formation efficiency in the pregalactic
clouds. In the context of a standard CDM cosmology, $M_{\rm SB}$ lies between

  The spectra of the dwarf novae are dominated by emission lines of HI and HeI.
The large velocity and equivalent widths of these lines, in conjunction with
the fact that the lines are double-peaked in the highest inclination systems,
indicate an accretion disc origin. In the case of YZ Cnc and T Leo, for which
we obtained time-resolved data covering a complete orbital cycle, the emission
lines show modulations in their equivalent widths which are most probably
associated with the bright spot (the region where the gas stream collides with
the accretion disc). There are no clear detections of the secondary star in any
of the dwarf novae below the period gap, yielding upper limits of 10-30% for
the contribution of the secondary star to the observed K-band flux. In
conjunction with the K-band magnitudes of the dwarf novae, we use the derived
secondary star contributions to calculate lower limits to the distances to
these systems.
  The spectra of the novalike variables are dominated by broad, single-peaked
emission lines of HI and HeI - even the eclipsing systems we observed do not
show the double-peaked profiles predicted by standard accretion disc theory.

bulge, where it causes a distinctive asymmetric light distribution pattern.
Another large-scale structure is the grand-design 4-arm spiral pattern, most
clearly observed in the spatial distribution of molecular gas and HII-regions.
  In order to model the observed gas flow structure, we constructed a model for
the stellar mass distribution. For the inner 5 $\kpc$ we used the 3D
deprojected near-IR light distribution, as observed by the COBE/DIRBE
experiment, and added an analytical disk model outside the box as well as a
halo model. With this frozen mass distribution, we computed the stationary gas
flow for various deprojection parameters and pattern speeds. For all reasonable
parameter choices, we obtain a 4-armed spiral pattern, which can be matched to
the observed spiral arms.
  In the bar region, our model can explain the non-circular motion visible in
the terminal velocity curve as well as part of the forbidden velocities. Inside
the corotation, we also find 4 spiral arms, the nearest arm corresponds to the
3-kpc-arm, although only qualitatively. The missing southern 3-kpc-arm at the
far end of the galaxy is explained by running parallel to another arm. Close to
the center, we find gas on circular orbits forming a disk. Such a disk has been
observed in emission of the CS molecule, however only part of the disk appears
to be occupied by dense enough gas to be traced by CS. Further we compare our

followed by an episode of enhanced mass transfer from the secondary if the mass
transfer rate in GRO J1655-40 is within a factor < 10 of the stability limit.
We argue that irradiation of the secondary during the onset of the outburst
driven by the thermal instability in the outer disc can increase the mass
transfer rate above the minimum value required for stable accretion. This will
then produce the period of near-constant X-ray emission seen in this system.
This scenario can also explain the observed anti-correlation between the
optical and X-ray fluxes. It is generally accepted that optical emission in
low-mass X-ray binaries is produced by irradiation of the outer disc by X-rays.
There is also strong circumstantial evidence that in order for the outer disc
to see the irradiating flux, it must be warped. Depending on the warp
propagation mechanism, either a burst of mass from the secondary or viscous
decay are likely to decrease the degree of warping, thereby causing the
decrease in the observed optical flux while the X-ray flux remains constant or
even increases, exactly as observed in GRO J1655-40. Finally, the decrease of
the disc warping and, therefore, irradiation will cause the disc to become
unstable once again, terminating the outburst.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.5,9,45,astro-ph

found at large distance (~10 kpc) from the center of a galaxy and is not
necessarily centered on it. Similarly large quantities of ionized gas could be
hidden in these systems as well. The properties of some of the gas reservoirs
are similar to the median properties of the High-Velocity Clouds (HVCs); two of
the HI reservoirs are catalogued HVCs. The association of the HI with the dwarf
spheroidals might thus provide a link between the HVCs and stars. We show that
the HI content of the Local Group dSphs and dIrrs exhibits a sharp decline if
the galaxy is within 250 kpc of either the Milky Way or M31. This can be
explained if both galaxies have a sufficiently massive x-ray emitting halo that
produces ram-pressure stripping if a dwarf ventures too close to either giant
spiral. We also investigate tidal stripping of the dwarf galaxies and find that
although it may play a role, it cannot explain the apparent total absence of
neutral gas in most dSph galaxies at distances less than 250 kpc. For the
derived mean density of the hot gas, n_0 = 2.5e-5 cm^-2, ram-pressure stripping
is found to be more than an order of magnitude more effective in removing the
gas from the dSph galaxies. The hot halo, with an inferred mass of 1e10 solar
masses, may represent a reservoir of ~1000 destroyed dwarf systems, either HVCs
or true dwarf galaxies similar to those we observe now.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",1.0,27,44,astro-ph

molecular clouds. However, the interpretation of these data requires comparison
with numerical simulations. To address this issue, SPH simulations of driven
and decaying, supersonic, turbulent flows with and without self-gravity are
presented. In addition, random Gaussian velocity fields are analyzed to
estimate the influence of variance effects. To characterize the flow
properties, the pdf's of the density, of the line-of-sight velocity centroids,
and of the line centroid increments are studied. This is supplemented by a
discussion of the dispersion and the kurtosis of the increment pdf's, as well
as the spatial distribution of velocity increments for small spatial lags. From
the comparison between different models of interstellar turbulence, it follows
that the inclusion of self-gravity leads to better agreement with the observed
pdf's in molecular clouds. The increment pdf's for small spatial lags become
exponential for all considered velocities. However, all the processes
considered here lead to non-Gaussian signatures, differences are only gradual,
and the analyzed pdf's are in addition projection dependent. It appears
therefore very difficult to distinguish between different physical processes on

that galaxy-galaxy encounters are not the sole cause of activity in ELGs since

with a recent measurement of the mass power spectrum at redshift z=2.5 from Lya
forest data to derive constraints on cosmological parameters and test the
inflation+CDM scenario of structure formation. By treating the inflationary
spectral index n as a free parameter, we can find successful fits to the COBE
and Lya forest constraints in Omega_m=1 models with and without massive
neutrinos and in low-Omega_m models with and without a cosmological constant.
Within each class of model, the combination of COBE and the Lya forest P(k)
constrains a parameter combination of the form (Omega_m h^a n^b Omega_b^c),
with different indices for each case. This new constraint breaks some of the
degeneracies in cosmological parameter determinations from other measurements.
The Lya forest P(k) provides the first measurement of the slope of the linear
mass power spectrum on ~Mpc scales, and it confirms a basic prediction of the
inflationary CDM scenario: a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of primeval
fluctuations (n~1) that bends towards k^{n-4} on small scales. Considering
additional observational data, we find that COBE-normalized, Omega_m=1 models
that match the Lya forest P(k) do not match the observed masses of rich galaxy
clusters and that a low-Omega_m model with a cosmological constant provides the
best overall fit, even without the direct evidence for cosmic acceleration from
supernovae. Modest improvements in the Lya forest P(k) measurement could
greatly restrict the allowable region of parameter space for CDM models,
constrain the contribution of tensor fluctuations to CMB anisotropy, and
achieve a more stringent test of the current consensus model of structure
formation.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.2,26,70,astro-ph

brightest source in gamma-rays and was significantly detected by EGRET and
COMPTEL. The EGRET experiment observed a time-variable flux at energies above
100 MeV, which reached in a 2-week flaring period (December 30, 1996 to January
14, 1997) its highest flux level observed during the CGRO-era. COMPTEL,
however, does not observe obvious time variability at energies below ~30 MeV

this outburst is solely a high-energy (>100 MeV) phenomenon. The energy
spectrum between 3 MeV and 10 GeV is well represented by a simple power-law
model. Below 3 MeV a spectral turnover is indicated. Performing spectral
analysis for different time periods, we found evidence for a spectral hardening
during the flaring period, which is consistent with the flare occurring mainly
at the higher energies and with its absence at COMPTEL energies of a few MeV.
This may be interpreted as an indication that the emission in the EGRET energy
range is dominated by a different radiation mechanism than the MeV emission. We
argue that the most likely mechanism for the high-energy flare is
inverse-Compton scattering of reprocessed accretion-disk radiation.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.1,9,45,astro-ph

while the gold atom cannot bind a positron. Our calculations reveal the
importance of the relativistic effects for positron binding to heavy atoms. The
role of these effects was studied by varying the value of the fine structure

are essentially different from that for a positron interacting with an atom.
Therefore, the calculation of electron affinities cannot serve as a test of the
method used for positron binding in the non-relativistic case. However, it is
still a good test of the relativistic calculations. Our calculated electron
affinities for silver (1.327 eV) and gold (2.307 eV) atoms are in very good

The width is taken to be sufficiently wide that a coninuum description is

analyze the mechanism of crossing a barrier. There can be two dominant
mechanisms. They are: end crossing and hairpin crossing. We find the free
energy of activation for the hairpin crossing is two times that for end
crossing. In both cases, the activation energy has a square root dependence on
the temperature $T$, leading to a non-Arrhenius form for the rate. We also show
that there is a special time dependent solution of the model, which corresponds
to a kink in the chain, confined to the region of the barrier. The movement of
the polymer from one side to the other is equivalent to the motion of the kink
on the chain in the reverse direction. We also consider the translocation of
hydrophilic polypeptides across hydrophobic pores, a process that is quite
common in biological systems. Biological systems accomplish this by having a

the induced radion dynamics, the inflating branes roll towards the minimum of
the radion potential, thereby exiting inflation and reheating the Universe. In
the slow roll part of the potential, the 'TeV' branes have maximum inflation
rate and energy as their coupling to the radion and bulk modes have minimum

results decayin a decrease of brane's canonical vacuum energy $\Lambda_4$.
However, at the minimum of the potential $\Lambda_4$ is small but not

large radion mass and strong suppression to the bulk modes, moduli problems and

This method treats the ""particles"" in the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation as

  $\rho$, required to reconstruct the quantum wavefunctions. Here, we compare
results obtained via the MWLS procedure to exact results obtained either
analytically or by numerical solution of the time dependent Schr\""odinger
equation. Two systems are considered: firstly, dynamics in a harmonic well and
secondly tunneling dynamics in a double well potential. In the case of
tunneling in the double well potential, the quantum potential acts to lower the
barrier separating the right and left hand sides of the well permitting
trajectories to pass from one side to another.
  However, as probability density passes from one side to the other, the
effective barrier begins to rise and eventually will segregate trajectories in
one side from the other. We note that the MWLS trajectories exhibited long time
stability in the purely harmonic cases. However, this stability was not evident
in the barrier crossing dynamics. Comparisons to exact trajectories obtained
via wave packet calculations indicate that the MWLS trajectories tend to
underestimate the effects of constructive and destructive interference effects.","{'term': u'quant-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.0,15,1,quant-ph

and an irregular morphology in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS). These clusters
are chosen to test the abilities and limitations of the RASS in terms of
cluster fluxes and cluster morphologies. Therefore some ``worst'' cases are
used here. X-ray observations with the ROSAT/HRI and optical spectroscopic
observations are carried out. The ROSAT/HRI observations, which have a much
better spatial resolution than the RASS, reveal in two of the three cases a
significantly different morphology than seen in the RASS. The reasons are point
sources which could not be resolved in the RASS and were therefore confused
with the cluster emission. For A3570 we could confirm the relaxed state of the
cluster by the optical determination of a small velocity dispersion. In the
cluster with the lowest flux (Abell 901) the countrate measurement is strongly
affected by point sources, in the two other cases the countrate measurements of
the RASS are reliable, i.e. they are reproduced by the ROSAT/HRI measurement.
We conclude that for clusters with a flux of a few times 10^{-12} erg/cm^2/s or
smaller, which show at the same time a non-relaxed morphology, the flux
measurement of the RASS can be seriously affected by fore- or background
sources. We point out that an all-sky survey of a second ABRIXAS mission would

redshift z=3.1 Ly alpha emitters. Here we report on the spectroscopic
identification of 9 Ly alpha emitters at z=3.13, obtained with the FORS
spectrograph at Unit 1 of the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT UT1). The spectra
of these high redshift objects show a narrow, isolated Ly alpha emission with
very faint (frequently undetected) continuum, indicating a large equivalent
width. No other features are visible in our spectra. Our Ly alpha emitters are
quite similar to those found by Hu (1998), Cowie & Hu (1998) and Hu et al.
(1998). Using simple population synthesis models, on the assumption that these
sources are regions of star formation, we conclude that the nebulae are nearly
optically thick and must have a very low dust content, in order to explain the
high observed Ly alpha equivalent widths. For the cosmological and star
formation parameters we adopted, the total stellar mass produced would seem to
correspond to the formation of rather small galaxies, some of which are perhaps
destined to merge. The implied star formation density in our sampled comoving
volume is probably somewhat smaller than, but of the same order of magnitude as
the star formation density at z=3 derived by other authors from Lyman-break
galaxy surveys. This result agrees with the expectation that the Ly alpha
emitters are a low-metallicity (or low-dust) tail in a distribution of star
forming regions at high redshifts. Finally, the Ly alpha emitters may
contribute as many H-ionizing photons as QSOs at z=3.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.1111111111111111,26,31,astro-ph

abundance and redshift distributions of objects detectable in ground-based
searches with state-of-the-art technology. An advantage of the SZ approach is
that the total SZ flux density depends only on the thermal energy of the
intracluster gas and not on its spatial or temperature structure, in contrast
to the X-ray luminosity. Because ground-based surveys will be characterized by
arcminute angular resolution, they will resolve a large fraction of the cluster
population. I quantify the resulting consequences for the cluster selection
function; these include less efficient cluster detection compared to idealized
point sources and corresponding steeper integrated source counts. This implies,
contrary to expectations based on a point source approximation, that deep
surveys are better than wide ones in terms of maximizing the number of detected
objects. At a given flux density sensitivity and angular resolution, searches
at millimeter wavelengths (bolometers) are more efficient than centimeter
searches (radio), due to the form of the SZ spectrum. Possible ground-based
surveys could discover up to $\sim 100$ clusters per square degree at a

Although there is no evidence for any broad line-like emissions in the MeV
region, these data further confirm the presence of a hard tail at energies
above several hundred keV. In particular, the spectrum at MeV energies can be
described as a power-law with a photon spectral index of $\alpha$ = -3.2, with
no evidence for a cutoff at high energies. For the 200 keV to 5 MeV spectrum,
we provide a quantitative description of the underlying electron spectrum, in
the context of a hybrid thermal/non-thermal model for the emission. The

dwarfs to giants is significantly larger for the five groups with luminous
X-ray halos than for the one marginally X-ray detected group, (2) the composite
GLF for the luminous X-ray groups is consistent in shape with that for rich
clusters, (3) the composite group GLF rises more steeply at the faint end than
that of the field, (4) the shape difference between the field and composite
group GLF's results mostly from the population of non-emission line galaxies,
whose dwarf-to-giant ratio is larger in the denser group environment than in
the field, and (5) the non-emission line dwarfs are more concentrated about the
group center than the non-emission line giants. This last result indicates that
the dwarfs and giants occupy different orbits (i.e., have not mixed completely)
and suggests that the populations formed at a different times. Our results show
that the shape of the GLF varies with environment and that this variation is
due primarily to an increase in the dwarf-to-giant ratio of quiescent galaxies
in higher density regions, at least up to the densities characteristic of X-ray
luminous poor groups. This behavior suggests that, in some environments, dwarfs
are more biased than giants with respect to dark matter. This trend conflicts
with the prediction of standard biased galaxy formation models. (Abridged)","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",1.0,49,85,astro-ph

the solid is stable against all other fluctuations at least upto densities as
low as $\rho \sigma^2 = 0.88$. Our system does not show any phase transition so
diverging correlation lengths leading to finite size effects and slow
relaxations do not exist. The dislocation pair formation probability is
estimated from the fraction of moves rejected due to the constraint which

the UVX absorptions. We provide an in-depth comparison between the MHD model
and the Sy 1 galaxy NGC 5548, which at high spectral resolution exhibits a
number of discrete UV absorption components. We find that: (1) the total column
densities of Ovii, Oviii and H, are reproduced by constraining the UV ion
column densities of Civ and Nv in each component to lie within a factor of 2 of
their observed values and optimizing over the possible sets of component
ionization states and Civ column densities; (2) the WA exists in the outer part
of the wind and is not a continuation of the flow in the BLR; and (3) the WA
extends in radial and polar directions and is ionization-stratified. X-ray
absorption is found to be heavily biased towards smaller r, and UV absorption
originates at larger distances from the central continuum source. We show that
the discrete absorption components along the line-of-sight are intrinsically
clumpy. Density differences between kinematic components result in a range of
ionization and recombination timescales. We further test the applicability of
the MHD wind to WAs in general, by constructing a quasi-continuous flow model,
and extending it to arbitrary aspect angles. We estimate the fraction of Sy 1s
having detectable WAs with larger Ovii column density than Oviii, and the range
of total H column densities. We also find that the ratio of Ovii to Oviii

The external field problem and Klein's paradox are discussed and then resolved
by introducing the so-called fermionic projector, a global object in space-time

book is to give a precise definition of the fermionic projector and to employ
methods of hyperbolic differential equations for its detailed analysis. The
fermionic projector makes it possible to formulate a new type of variational
principles in space-time. The mathematical tools for the analysis of the
corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations are developed. A particular variational
principle is proposed which gives rise to an effective interaction showing many
similarities to the interactions of the standard model.

to the peak flux distribution, the > 1 s t_{50} duration distribution, and the

range of a GRB detector is resolved by this model when blast wave physics and
detector triggering criteria are taken into account. Some surprising

outflows are collimated. This is ~ 3 orders of magnitude larger than normally

this paper. A study of the locations, sizes, and physical characteristics of
local interstellar gas, i.e. ``astronephography,'' is included, and relies upon
the improved distance measurements provided by Hipparcos parallax measurements.
All spectra of more distant sight lines contain absorption features due to
intervening local gas, and more distant structures can only be studied
accurately if components due to the LISM have been isolated. Towards this end,
high resolution (R ~ 95,000), high signal-to-noise (S/N ~ 110 to 250) Na I
spectra of 11 nearby stars in the direction of Puppis-Vela have been obtained.
Toward Puppis-Vela, absorption due to the LIC was not observed, but components
at three distinct velocities were found, and the extent of the local gas
producing the features was estimated. The conclusions regarding the UV spectrum
of gamma^2 Vel presented by Fitzpatrick & Spitzer (1994) were re-examined in
light of this new LISM data, and the ambiguity in their conclusions about
several absorption components is resolved. The stars in Puppis-Vela flank the
region of the apparent extension of the Local Bubble (or Cavity) known as the
beta CMa tunnel,and measurements of the Na I column density towards the sample
stars have been used to modify existing estimates of the extent of the tunnel.

possibility of observing Z>137 bound states and transitions at the lower

orbiting protons will coalesce to form a nucleus (after beta-decay of some
protons to neutrons), with a stability curve different to that of free nuclei.

HK survey, and the Hamburg/ESO survey, which have been undertaken in order to
provide targets for high-resolution spectroscopy with the Subaru HDS and other
large telescopes. We compare basic properties of these two surveys and their
current status, and add some historical remarks.
  The candidate selection procedures of both surveys are described in detail.
We evaluate the candidate selection by comparing effective yields (EYs) of the
survey techniques for the identification of metal-poor stars. It is found that
EY for stars below [Fe/H]=-2.0 in the HES can be up to 80% for stars selected
by automatic classification from machine-scanned unwidened plates, whereas in
the HK survey, where stars are selected by visual inspection of widened survey
plates, the EY is between 11% and 32%, depending on whether a pre-selection
based on BV photometry has been applied.
  Finally, we describe techniques used for determining stellar parameters of
the survey stars by means of moderate resolution follow-up spectroscopy, and
additional UBV photometry. While follow-up observations of HES stars have just
been started, the HK survey has already produced a list of ~4700 stars with
estimates of [Fe/H] typically precise to +/-0.2 dex, some 1000 of which have
[Fe/H]<-2.0, and roughly 100 of which have [Fe/H]<-3.0.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",1.0,19,24,astro-ph

0), while alternate Jahn-Teller deformations occur in the ab-plane (mode Q_2).
These deformations stabilize a certain type of orbital ordering. The resulting

account both e_g and t_{2g} orbitals. The main result is that antiferromagnetic
(ferromagnetic) coupling along the c-direction (ab-planes) can be understood
only if the Jahn-Teller energy is much larger than the superexchange couplings,

on weak Jahn-Teller coupling which instead predicts elongation along the c-axis

however, regions of the phase space and experimental conditions such that the

important diagnostic tool of the chemical evolution of damped Ly alpha systems
(DLAs). The S/Zn ratio is not affected by differential dust depletion and is an
excellent estimator of the alpha/Fe ratio. We report 6 new determinations of
sulphur abundance in DLAs at zabs greater than or equal to 2 with already known
zinc abundances. The combination with extant data from the literature provides
a measure of the S/Zn abundance ratio for a total of 11 high redshift DLA
systems. The observed [S/Zn] ratios do not show the characteristic [alpha/Fe]
enhancement observed in metal-poor stars of the Milky Way at comparable level
of metallicity ([Zn/H] ~ -1). The behaviour of DLAs data is consistent with a
general trend of decreasing [S/Zn] ratio with increasing metallicity [Zn/H].
This would be the first evidence of the expected decrease of the alpha/Fe ratio
in the course of chemical evolution of DLA systems. However, in contrast to
what observed in our Galaxy, the alpha/iron-peak ratio seems to attain solar
values when the metallicity is still low ([Zn/H] < -1) and to decrease below
solar values at higher metallicities. The behaviour of the alpha/Fe ratio
challenges the frequently adopted hypothesis that high redshift DLAs are
progenitors of spiral galaxies and favours instead an origin in galaxies
characterized by low star formation rates, in agreement with the results from
imaging studies of low redshift DLAs, where the candidate DLA galaxies show a
variety of morphological types including dwarfs and LSBs and only a minority of
spirals.","{'term': u'astro-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.3333333333333333,28,54,astro-ph

core levels shifts and charge transfer. The calculated CLBE shifts agree well
with experiment, and permit an unambiguous separation into initial-state and
screening contributions. Interestingly, the screening contribution is large and
cannot be neglected in any reasonable description. Comparison of the calculated
results with the predictions of simple models show that these models are not
adequate to describe the realistic situation. On the positive side, the

magnetoresistance in La_{1-x}Ca_{x}MnO_{3} (x \approx 0.33) films has been
examined. The lattice defects are introduced by irradiating the film with
high-energy (\simeq 6 MeV) electrons with a maximal fluence of about 2\times
10^{17} cm^{-2}. This comparatively low dose of irradiation produces rather
small radiation damage in the films. The number of displacements per atom (dpa)
in the irradiated sample is about 10^{-5}. Nethertheless, this results in an
appreciable increase in the film resistivity. The percentage of resistivity
increase in the ferromagnetic metallic state (below the Curie tempetature
T_{c}) was much greater than that observed in the insulating state (above
T_{c}). At the same time irradiation has much less effect on T_{c} or on the
magnitude of the colossal magnetoresistance. A possible explanation of such
behavior is proposed.","{'term': u'cond-mat.mtrl-sci', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.2,25,20,cond-mat.mtrl-sci

for the study of the QCD phase boundary and formation of a quark-gluon plasma.
A universal feature of phase boundaries is the appearance of increased

compared to a reference. In this paper I consider a particular aspect of EbyE
analysis emphasizing global-variables variance comparisons and the central
limit theorem. I find that the central limit theorem is, in a broader
interpretation, a statement about the scale invariance of total variance for a
measure distribution, which in turn relates to the scale-dependent symmetry
properties of the distribution.. I further generalize this concept to the
relationship between the scale dependence of a covariance matrix for all
conserved measures defined on a dynamical system and a matrix of covariance
integrals defined on two-point measure spaces, which points the way to a
detailed description of the symmetry dynamics of a complex measure system.
Finally, I relate this generalized description to several recently proposed or
completed event-by-event analyses.","{'term': u'hep-ph', 'scheme': u'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}",0.0,39,31,hep-ph

higher z our previous analysis performed on the NTT field alone, we find that
the distribution of the galaxy disk sizes at different cosmic epochs is within
the range predicted by typical CDM models. However, the observed size
distribution of faint (M_B>-19) galaxies is skewed with respect to the CDM
predictions and an excess of small-size disks (R_d<2 kpc) is already present at
z~ 0.5. The excess persists up to z~3 and involves brighter galaxies . Such an
